<p>TEI Boilerplate is a lightweight solution for publishing styled
<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI</a> (<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative</a>)
P5 content directly in modern browsers. With TEI Boilerplate, TEI XML files can
be served directly to the web without server-side processing or translation to
HTML. Our <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/demo.xml">TEI Boilerplate
Demo</a> illustrates many TEI
features rendered by TEI Boilerplate.</p>

<h1>Browser Compatibility</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate requires a robust, modern browser to do its work. It is
compatible with current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet
Explorer (IE 9). If you have problems with TEI Boilerplate with a modern
browser, please let us know by filing a bug report at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/teiboilerplate/tickets/">https://sourceforge.net/p/teiboilerplate/tickets/</a>.  </p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>TEI is a language designed primarily to express the content of documents.
Projects that use TEI are responsible for developing their own methods of
augmenting or converting it to a presentation-ready state for the web. Two
potential paths to reach this goal are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transforming TEI to HTML using XSLT. The output HTML is typically styled with
CSS.</li>
<li>Attaching a CSS stylesheet directly to the TEI XML.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. While HTML is the
language of the web and, as such, is well supported browsers, its descriptive
capabilities are much less expressive than TEI. When TEI is transformed to HTML,
much of the richness of the TEI is lost or obscured in the resulting HTML.
However, the browser understands HTML very well and knows, for example, when to
initiate retrieval of a document based on certain user events, such as clicking
a link. The second option, CSS-styled TEI, allows for all of the TEI data to be
delivered directly to the browser. However, while the browser may apply CSS to
format and style a TEI document, the browser does not understand the semantics
of TEI. For instance, the browser does not understand that TEI's <code>&lt;ptr&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> elements are linking elements.  </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate bridges the gap between these two approaches by creating an
environment in which TEI XML is delivered directly to browser, and styled by
CSS. We accomplish this by making use of the built-in XSLT (1.0) capabilities of
browsers to embed the TEI XML within a minimal HTML5 shell document. The TEI XML
document is embedded, with minimal modifications, within this HTML5 shell.
Features expected of web documents, such as clickable links and display of
linked images, are enabled through selective transformation of a very small
number of TEI elements and attributes. </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate is not intended to be a replacement for the many excellent XSLT
solutions for publishing and displaying TEI/XML on the web. It is intended to be
a <em>simple and lightweight</em> alternative to more complex XSLT solutions. There are
both practical and theoretical advantages to this lightweight approach.</p>

<h2>Practical Benefits</h2>

<p>XSLT is far more powerful than CSS and can manipulate XML documents in ways that
CSS cannot. XSLT can radically transform documents and can combine multiple XML
data sources into a single output file or multiple output files. But the power
of XSLT comes at a cost. XSLT is a far more complex language than CSS and has a
far steeper learning curve. There are relatively few expert XSLT programmers
compared to the numbers of expert Web developers with extensive knowledge of
HTML/CSS/JavaScript. </p>

<p>On the other hand, JavaScript is an extremely capable language for doing fancy
things with XML content. JavaScript frameworks like JQuery and EXT JS, and the
major browsers provide excellent support for manipulating the DOM (Document
Object Model) of the web page. With TEI Boilerplate, the TEI document becomes
part of the DOM, and JavaScript may then be used to perform more complex
transformations, movements, and other manipulations of the TEI content than can
be achieved with CSS alone. Our <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/demo.xml">TEI Boilerplate
Demo</a> includes a simple
example in the “Toolbox,” with a check box that uses JavaScript to hide and
reveal the page breaks in a portion of the demo document. </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate gives HTML/CSS/JavaScript documents direct access to original
TEI content, and it gives TEI documents direct access to the substantial
capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the dominant document format, styling
language, and (client-side) programming language of the web. TEI Boilerplate
aims for simplicity and elegance, but it also facilitates complexity and
innovation by exposing TEI content directly to capabilities of JavaScript, the
many powerful JavaScript frameworks, and CSS. </p>

<p>In teaching contexts, TEI Boilerplate may be a useful solution. Students and 
scholars new to TEI are rightly excited and enthused as they encode their first
documents and experience the expressive power of TEI encoding. But too often
that initial excitement and enthusiasm dissipates when new TEI users inquire
about publishing their documents on the web and are confronted with sometimes
overwhelming details about an unfamiliar programming language, XSLT, and other
information about server side processing, transformation engines, and so on.
With TEI Boilerplate, users can simply add a single line of code to their
documents to allow modern browsers to produce formatted output of their TEI
content. And that display may be further tweaked and customized using CSS.</p>

<h3>TEI Boilerplate and Omeka</h3>

<p>TEI Boilerplate is a simple solution for delivering TEI documents through
<a href="http://www.omeka.org">Omeka</a>. No additional software or plugins are necessary.
One can simply simply host the TEI Boilerplate XSLT, JavaScript, and CSS files
on a server (or as items in Omeka) and change any links to point to those online
files. </p>

<p>Note: Some browsers apply the “same origin” security policy to XSLT stylesheets,
which prohibits the use of XSLT from a different domain than the input document.
For this reason, it is best to host the TEI Boilerplate files in the same domain
as the Omeka installation.</p>

<h2>Theoretical Advantages</h2>

<p>The power of TEI lies in the richness and expressiveness of its vocabulary. But
much of that richness and expressiveness is lost in the translation to HTML. TEI
Boilerplate largely preserves the integrity of the TEI document. Since the
original TEI document is delivered directly to the browser, the source TEI can
be easily accessed and saved to the desktop or mobile device.</p>

<p>Scholars labor over the intricate encoding of TEI documents, encoding that may
represent sophisticated readings and analysis. But with the typical XSLT
publishing solution, which transforms the TEI to HTML, much or all of the
richness of the TEI content is lost. Furthermore, the presentation of the
document is targeted at the HTML surrogate rather than the intricately encoded
TEI document. This results in a conceptual disconnect between the design of the
document and the original TEI encoding. By exposing the TEI directly to the
browser, one may format the TEI directly, applying intentional design to a
sophisticated model of a source document. If one wishes to manipulate the
document using JavaScript, one may manipulate the TEI directly. Scholars are
likely to be intimately familiar with their TEI documents, and their engagement
with and understanding of these documents may benefit when the formatting and
processing is targeted at the TEI itself, rather than at an HTML surrogate.</p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate respects the integrity of the TEI document, and keeps the TEI
document central throughout the publication process.</p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>When a TEI document using TEI Boilerplate is accessed by a browser, the browser
reads a line (the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction) in the file that
indicates that the XML should be processed by the TEI Boilerplate XSLT
stylesheet. The browser then processes the TEI according to the rules of the
stylesheet, which results in an HTML5 shell document within which the TEI
document is embedded. A very small number of TEI elements and attributes (e.g.
<code>&lt;ptr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, and <code>@rend</code>) are converted to their closest HTML
equivalents to enable features such as clickable links, display of images, and
support for inline CSS. The HTML shell contains a link to the TEI Boilerplate
CSS file, which tells the browser how to style the full document.</p>

<h1>Using it in Your Project</h1>

<p>Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiboilerplate/files/">TEI Boilerplate
files</a>, and host the
<code>teibp</code> directory on a web server.</p>

<p>The simplest way to use TEI Boilerplate (TEIBP) is simply to add your TEI files
to the <code>teibp/content</code> directory of TEI Boilerplate and include the following
xml-stylesheet processing instruction at the top of your TEI documents, after
the XML declaration and before the root <code>&lt;TEI&gt;</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="teibp.xsl"?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may then access your TEI files from a modern browser and see the resulting
styled document.</p>

<h1>TEI Boilerplate and CSS</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate makes extensive use of CSS to generate styled documents in the
browser. The CSS is drawn from three possible sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>External css stylesheets: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/css/teibp.css"><code>teibp.css</code></a> includes
default styles for the HTML shell and TEI document. </li>
<li><a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/css/custom.css"><code>custom.css</code></a> is an
empty stylesheet provided as a placeholder for user styles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements with <code>@scheme="css"</code>  within the TEI document are used
to generate CSS declarations understood by the browser.</li>
<li>The global <code>@rend</code> attribute may be used to include inline CSS in TEI
documents. The contents of <code>@rend</code> are copied to <code>@style</code>, which is understood
by the browser.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Customizing the Look</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate includes a default “theme” and some alternative themes. These
are provided mostly as an illustration of TEI Boilerplate's capabilities. Users
may modify these supplied themes in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By supplying <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements with <code>@scheme="css"</code> within the
<code>&lt;tagsDecl&gt;</code> section of your TEI document. TEI Boilerplate will automatically
convert the <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements into CSS declarations  in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element
of the HTML5 shell that surrounds the TEI document after the simple XSLT
transformation. TEI elements that use the <code>@rendition</code> attribute to point to
<code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> styles will be styled accordingly. This mechanism is similar to
using HTML's <code>@class</code> to point to CSS classes. See the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD57">TEI
Guidelines</a>
for more details on <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> and <code>@rendition</code>. The TEI Boilerplate <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">TEI
template</a>
(<a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">teibp.xml</a>) also includes
examples.</li>
<li>By adding custom CSS to the <code>custom.css</code> file located in the <code>teibp/css</code>
directory. The HTML shell created by TEI Boilerplate includes a link to the
custom.css file. This file is empty by default. You may add user styles to this
file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The TEI Boilerplate Template</h1>

<p>An important component of TEI Boilerplate is a “boilerplate” <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">TEI
template</a>
(<a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">teibp.xml</a>), a very
simple TEI file, with some XML comments about where one might typically put
basic information (e.g., title, author, bibliographic details of any source
material). The most important features of the TEI Boilerplate template are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instructions with links to the TEI Boilerplate
XSLT and CSS files.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibpstyles.xml">pre-defined set of <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code>
elements</a> with
generally useful styles for describing a source document or for use in a
born-digital TEI document. For instance, the template includes styles for bold,
italicized, underlined, and “normal” text; for left-aligned, right-aligned,
centered, and fully justified text; for indentation of verse lines; block
quotes; and so on. These styles are discussed in more detail in a separate
document: <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibpstyles.xml">Styles available in the TEI Boilerplate
Template</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Users of TEI Boilerplate may choose to use the styles provided in the template,
and add to, modify, or replace them. As explained above, <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements,
along with <code>@rendition</code> and <code>@rend</code> are all used by TEI Boilerplate to produced
styled documents in the browser. Thus, TEI authors may achieve substantial
results by using these standard TEI features, without the need to edit any of
the TEI Boilerplate code.</p>
