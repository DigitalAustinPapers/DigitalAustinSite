*p*Your letter of the *date_mentioned n="04-10-1825">10th Inst,*/date_mentioned*  was left at my *location_mentioned*House */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="04-24-1825">yesterday*/date_mentioned*. I
was from home I have Carefully read it and considered the contents
It appears to me there is no doubt but the symptoms yours describes
are produced from an affection of the kidneys which I think it 
probable has been brought on by your Long Sedentary habit, and I should
hope that a change in that Respect with a moderate use of some
cooling diureticks will Relieve you — Amongst the Vegetable
Diureticks those which are Emolient are best (viz) Slipiry Elm
Bark Water Melon Seeds. Mauve or Mallows, the Inner Bark of
Pine, Casteal Soap, the stronger diuretics are Fox Glove, Nettle,
Prickley Pear, Arsmart Parsley Roots.—these are all used in form
of tea Sometimes a small Pill of Opium may be Proper, the more
Powerful are Muriatic or Nitric Accid. Glaubus Salts Lime Water
etc I send you a Vial of the Accid Diluted to save the cork and a
vial of Volatille Alcaline Salt, the Salt is a Real and eiBcatious
Medicine the way to use it is, Take about half a Tea Spoonful of it
put it in a tumbler and pour the tumbler half full of Vinegar, and
drink it off while in a State of evervescence this may be repeated
three or four times a day — 30 or 40 drops of the Accid in half a
tumbler of water will be a dose — your diet should be more Simple
than Ordinary and Wine and Ardent Spirits used more sparingly—
