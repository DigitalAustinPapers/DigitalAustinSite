*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="04-12-1832">12 April 1832*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Sir*/p*

*p*I wrote you on the *date_mentioned n="04-09-1832">9th*/date_mentioned*, since then *person_mentioned*Col Butler*/person_mentioned* arrived here and
proceeds to *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned* to settle his private business with *person_mentioned*Whitesides*/person_mentioned*
and *person_mentioned*others*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have nothing particular to add to my letter of the *date_mentioned n="04-09-1832">9th*/date_mentioned*. Peace
and harmony in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and especially in the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*is all important,
and I hope no event will transpire to interrupt the individual or
public tranquility of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*. Nothing more is known of
the State of things in *location_mentioned*mexico */location_mentioned*than what I communicated in my
last— you will see by the Registro, that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*is reported to be in
a revolutionary situation. I have contradicted this false report in
a letter to*person_mentioned* Mr. Alaman,*/person_mentioned* and everything will end well and 
prosperously if prudence and moderation are used by the *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*, but they
must be prudent and quiet.*/p*

*p*I wish you would make out the items of my account with *person_mentioned*Butler*/person_mentioned*
and calculate the interest, one of my notes to him is paid—take that
up and arrange what has been paid on the others as you and him
may think right.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*[John T.] Mason*/person_mentioned* I presume will go to the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*and in that
event I shall return *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="05-xx-1832">May*/date_mentioned*, for he is authorised to settle the
*person_mentioned*Hawkins*/person_mentioned* business—my anxiety to have that matter finally closed will
probably take me *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*instead of going to *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*. If any money
can be had to make a payment to *person_mentioned*Butler*/person_mentioned*, or if you can make any
contract with him to finish the improvements on his house I wish
you would do so—at least so far as to take up the note that was
due in *date_mentioned n="01-xx-1832">Jany last*/date_mentioned*. I am anxious to have that dept [sic] paid, so as
to avoid the accumulation of interest.*/p*

*p*The consulta relative to the *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*who came in *date_mentioned n="04-xx-1832  -  06-xx-1832">between April
and June */date_mentioned*is favorably dispatched and will go by next mail to 
*person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*so that you can now push all the business and bring it to a
speedy close.*/p*

*p*Remember my *location_mentioned*reserve on the Colorado above the road, and above
Tannihill*/location_mentioned* I do not wish that interfered with by any means.    The<barker_pb n="765"/>
land is poor, but I think the situation will be healthy which is my
object in wishing to fix a *location_mentioned*residence */location_mentioned*there at some time when I can,
so as to have a retreat from the fevers, mosquitoes and insects of the
*location_mentioned*low country near the coast.*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*Keep peace and quietness in the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*at all hazards. The 
*person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*ought to have full confidence in me. I say that they must bear
a <hi rend="italic">great deal</hi> from military oppresion and still remain quiet and
patient. I refer you and the *person_mentioned*Ayto */person_mentioned*particularly to my letter of the
*date_mentioned n="04-09-1832">9th instant*/date_mentioned* and to the advice it contains on this subject.*/p*

*p*As regards the *person_mentioned*captains of vessells*/person_mentioned* who behave imprudently, as
the *person_mentioned*captain of the Boston packet*/person_mentioned* did, I hope the *person_mentioned*colonists */person_mentioned*will 
unanimously set their faces against them and against such conduct. I
expect that some schooners will have to be sunk, before they will
come to their senses, but that is <hi rend="italic">their </hi>affair— if they are in the
wrong I will not protect or countenance them and I hope none of
the *person_mentioned*colonists */person_mentioned*will— if they are wrongfully sunk, or ill treated let
them appeal to their own govt for redress and not to the *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*
who have nothing to do with the matter.*/p*

*p*Prudence and a <hi rend="italic">dead calm</hi> in the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*will insure a favorable
answer to the memorial—imprudence and rashness, even if just
cause is given, will totally defeat everything and ruin all.*/p*

*p*My standing motto—<hi rend="italic">" Fidelity to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*"</hi>—ought to be in every
man's mouth and repeated, instead of <hi rend="italic">many </hi>other things that are
said, <hi rend="italic">over cups</hi> and in moments of heat— it is a good toast and
ought to be used as a standing toast in the grog shops— try and
have it so.*/p*

*p*Remember me kindly to all*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. M. Williams*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I sent my motto in *date_mentioned n="12-xx-1831">Decr last*/date_mentioned* to *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* to be generally spread
amongst them at *location_mentioned*Brazoria*/location_mentioned*, but I never heard of his having 
mentioned it to any one—   ask him if he did.*/p*
