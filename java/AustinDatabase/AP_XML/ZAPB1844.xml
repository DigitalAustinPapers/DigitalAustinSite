<p>Austin to Elias R. Wightman, January 24, 1830. Instructions for surveying.   Schools.</p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I have sent <person_mentioned>Mr Selkerk</person_mentioned> for the purpose of making up another
set of hands so as to start another compass. The work that is
wanted will not be a very profitable job and rather bad railing.
I wish the <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>meandered, <location_mentioned>beginning at <person_mentioned>Jinnins</person_mentioned>' camp on Colorado
and meandering down to its mouth, thence along the coast to the
Karankaway Bay</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have understood that you had taken up a <location_mentioned>school </location_mentioned>and could not
leave there to survey, if this be the case I wish you to let <person_mentioned>Selkerk</person_mentioned>
have your compass. If it is in any manner injured I will pay you
its full value or should you wish to sell it I will give you Eighty
Dollars cash for it.</p>

<p>I wish you to speak to <person_mentioned>Burnham </person_mentioned>for the use of his best perogue
to take fresh water and provisions along the <location_mentioned>coast</location_mentioned>. We cannot do
without it and will pay for the hire if <person_mentioned>Burnham </person_mentioned>will not lend it.</p>

<p>Considering the badness of the running and the quantity of work
that must be done before <person_mentioned>Leagues </person_mentioned>can be run off I think that this job
will not be an object of sufficient importance for you to quit
your <location_mentioned>school</location_mentioned>. After the <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>is all meandered the <location_mentioned>creeks </location_mentioned>must also
be all meandered and a general plot of the whole made and then
laid off in <location_mentioned>Leagues</location_mentioned> so that it will not be a profitable job for it is
probable that not more than <location_mentioned>one third of the Leagues</location_mentioned> will be
taken for some years—you can do as you please— If you want this
job you have had the promise of it, and can get it.</p>

<p>I shall wait here untill the meanders of the <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>are all completed.</p>
<p>I think the best plan will be to let <person_mentioned>Selkerk </person_mentioned>have the compass.
Shall come by <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>on my return.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
