*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned*. *date_mentioned n="12-31-1829">31 Decr 1829*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear *person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*I have reflected very much on your removal to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and
after weighing the matter carefully I have become convinced that
it is my duty to advise your removal, and I now do so, and urge you
not to delay any longer than is absolutely necessary to close all your
affairs, or to put them in train to be closed*/p*

*p*I have peti[ti]oned the *person_mentioned*Govt of the State*/person_mentioned* for *location_mentioned*eleven Leagues of
land for you on Galveston Bay,*/location_mentioned* *location_mentioned*within Six or seven Miles of 
Galveston harbor,*/location_mentioned* if the half of that quantity is granted it will be a
fortune, My standing with this Govt justifies the expectation that
the whole will be granted but there will be a condition that the *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*
shall be void unless you actually remove to this *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*within *date_mentioned n="01-01-1832">two
years from tomorrow*/date_mentioned* (1 of Janry 1830) and the limit may possibly
be 18 months, tho. I have asked two years—*/p*

*p*There is a fine opening here for a good *person_mentioned*Merchant*/person_mentioned*, and a regular
trading shooner to ship produce such as corn, lard etc. to *location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned*
and *location_mentioned*vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* would make money rapidly— there is considerable
cotton made and some sugar— Beef, Tallow, pork, Lard, Mules etc
All goods can now be introduced free of duty but this previlege
expires the *date_mentioned n="11-01-1831">1 of Novr next*/date_mentioned* so that *date_mentioned n="Spring - 1830">next Spring*/date_mentioned* is the best time to
move or if you come in the *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1830">fall */date_mentioned*let it be before *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1830">November*/date_mentioned*, for after
that time you will have to pay enormous duties. I really do not
think that a greater prospect ever before presented itself and I shall
think that you are trifling with fortune if you do not embrace it.*/p*

*p*This matter ought to be considered in another point of view— I
am quite alone here— My beloved *person_mentioned*brother */person_mentioned*is no more— he has left
but one *person_mentioned*child */person_mentioned*and I had taken care to secure a *location_mentioned*large tract of land */location_mentioned*in
my *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned*s name, which will be a handsome provision [for] my
little *person_mentioned*nephew*/person_mentioned*— my constitution is much broken— at my death I
shall leave some land to some one and I wish to see all my *person_mentioned*sisters
children*/person_mentioned* provided for, The *location_mentioned*eleven Leagues */location_mentioned*I have petitioned for,
will be in the names of both of you and for the equal benefit of
both— that is half for *person_mentioned*Sisters children by Bryan,*/person_mentioned* and half for you,
to be disposed of as you think proper, this will be a handsome 
provision even if they get nothing more, It is now uncertain wheither
I shall ever Marry, and if I do not, I shall perhaps have some *location_mentioned*land*/location_mentioned*<barker_pb n="308"/>
to divide amongst them this however is uncertain, and I do not
urge your removal on account of any expectations of that kind,
I wish to secure you a certainty in the *location_mentioned*11 Leagues*/location_mentioned* and that is an
object worthy of removing to, seting aside every thing else— If
you want more land more can be had— I can now buy *location_mentioned*50 Leagues*/location_mentioned*
at about 8 to 400 dolls, pr. League and less— The *location_mentioned*11 Leagues*/location_mentioned* I
have petitioned for will cost you about $1000 including every thing,
and you will be allowed 4, 5, and 6, years to pay a part of that in
and the balance can be settled by me easily—*/p*

*p*I have not heretofore urged your removal because I have never
been so thoroughily convinced as I now am of the future rapid rise
of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*-— you have no idea of it, or you would be <hi rend="italic">here
before </hi>*date_mentioned n="04-xx-1830">April*/date_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and all— There is a good situation on the
land I have asked for you, for a *location_mentioned*Steam Saw Mill—*/location_mentioned* lumber sells
at *location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned* *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* etc at from 50 to 80 dolls, per 1000— none
can be imported from the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*. for it is a prohibited article— your
*person_mentioned*servants */person_mentioned*must be *person_mentioned*indented */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*hired by contract*/person_mentioned* executed before a
*person_mentioned*Jud[g]e*/person_mentioned* or *person_mentioned*Clerk of the County*/person_mentioned* with his certificate under seal-
indenture them for life at a small hire; and let each one acknowledge
in the indenture that he or she is indebted to you 5. 6. or 800 dolls,
according to the value of the *person_mentioned*slave*/person_mentioned*— No *person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*can be admitted,
but there is a special law guaranteeing all contracts made in a 
*location_mentioned*foreign country */location_mentioned*with *person_mentioned*servants */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*hirelings*/person_mentioned*-
Bring ail manner, and great quantities of fruit seeds with you and
some Gooseberry and rasberry roots, in particular*/p*

*p*Furniture is scarce here and high, but as we are all poor 
*person_mentioned*backwoodsmen*/person_mentioned*, costly furniture is unknown and unnessary, but you
ought to bring enough to be comfortable*/p*

*p*I have set my heart on your removal and I shall be dreadfully
disappointed if you do not— Consign any thing you wish to
send here to *person_mentioned*James W. Breedlove*/person_mentioned**location_mentioned* New Orleans */location_mentioned*with orders to ship
it to *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*Brazoria Texas*/location_mentioned*— Send your letters to *person_mentioned*Breedlove*/person_mentioned*,
<hi rend="italic">post paid </hi>and enquire of him as to vessels, freight, etc he is the
*person_mentioned*Mexican consul for *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* and my friend, do all your 
business with him— Send some letters directed to me, care of *person_mentioned*Hugh
McGuffin*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Post Master at the *location_mentioned*Sabine Parish*/location_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*Nachitoches*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* post
paid— as soon as I get an answer from the Govt I will write,
in the meantime prepare to move for I must have you here— You
must come indeed you <hi rend="italic">Must </hi>I have fine situations for building
in this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*and all round it, you can take choice I will live with you
until I marry—that is to say until I die—*person_mentioned*Brothers widow*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*little
Stephen*/person_mentioned* will join us, I wish the remnant of our *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*united once
more, and it can be done with all ease*/p*<barker_pb n="309"/>

*p*This is the most *person_mentioned*liberal and munificent Govt */person_mentioned*on *location_mentioned*earth */location_mentioned*to 
*person_mentioned*emigra[n]ts*/person_mentioned*— after being here one year you will oppose a change
even to *person_mentioned*Uncle Sam*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I can now help you—but if you delay it will be out of my
power—   <hi rend="italic">now then</hi> is the time—*/p*

*p*All the difficulties as to *person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*about which I wrote you are 
removed, by a new law excepting *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*from the Gen1 emancipation
law of *date_mentioned n="09-15-1829">15 Sepr*/date_mentioned* this applies to *person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*brought in before the time
expired for introducing them—this shews that the principle of
Slavery is admitted as to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and I have no doubt that in a few
years this will be a *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Slave */person_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*— I have no doubt that it is the
Settled policy of the present administration of this Govt to fill up
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*with *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*from the*location_mentioned* U. S*/location_mentioned*. as soon as possible and from
it into a *location_mentioned*State of this confederation,*/location_mentioned* it will be the best *location_mentioned*State in
the Mexican Union*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*Now is the golden Opportunity—if you loose it, such another will
never offer—*/p*

*p*I send this by way of *location_mentioned*Opelusas */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="01-01-1830">tomorrow */date_mentioned*I will write by way of
*location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*and in a few days by way of *location_mentioned*Nachitoches */location_mentioned*for fear some
of the letters may miscarry. I shall tax you for postage, but the
object is worth it for if you come to this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*I see nothing to
prevent your being rich <hi rend="italic">very </hi>rich in a few years— *location_mentioned*11 Leagues of
