and after his death a notorious scoundrel by the name of <person_mentioned>Fields</person_mentioned>
married the <person_mentioned>widow </person_mentioned>who denied haveing it but it was after discovered
by the <person_mentioned>Adms. of Vaughns estate</person_mentioned> and taken out of <person_mentioned>Field</person_mentioned>s possession. I
did not deem it proper to send them to <location_mentioned>N Orleans</location_mentioned> as you had some
four or five years ago instructed me to do but concluded to keep them
till I hear from you again on that subject— please write me the
first oportunity I will obey any orders that you may make relative
to your trunk send it <location_mentioned>down the river</location_mentioned> or keep possession of it till
called for— I am sorry I have not time to give you all the news
of the country, the local and domestic concerns of <location_mentioned>Hempstead County</location_mentioned>
as well as the politicks of the country— Give me a history of your
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>what the prospect is for makeing money there, or what
would be profitable taken to or from your <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— If you know
any thing of <person_mentioned>Doctor Andrews</person_mentioned> for Gods sake let me hear of him, I
feel interested in <person_mentioned>Andrews</person_mentioned> and would like to know that he is doing
well If he is with you tell him we have a flourishing little <location_mentioned>village</location_mentioned>
at the place he was endeavouring to get the <location_mentioned>seat of justice</location_mentioned> located
at for this county, <location_mentioned>on the head of the Bodark</location_mentioned>, called <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>.</p>
