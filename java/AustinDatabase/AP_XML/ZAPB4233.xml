<p><location_mentioned>New York </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="06-30-1831">30 June 1831</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Cousin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I hope my letter acknowledgeing receipt of yours of <date_mentioned n="03-17-1831">17 March last</date_mentioned>
has reached you ere this, in which I inclosed some directions recd
from <person_mentioned>Mr Burgh</person_mentioned>, one of our <person_mentioned>principal Ship Carpenters</person_mentioned>, relative to
the proper dimensions in which live Oak should be cut, to answer in
our <location_mentioned>Ship yards</location_mentioned>, for fear that letter may have miscarried, I inclose
a copy of it, as there is I understand<location_mentioned> on the banks of the Brazos</location_mentioned>, a
large quantity of that valuable wood, all the information that can be
obtained from such a man as <person_mentioned>Burgh</person_mentioned>, must I presume be of 
consequence.</p>

<p>In my letter alluded to above I signified my desire to become a
<person_mentioned>landholder </person_mentioned>in your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, if it could be done without interfering
with your plans or views, say the usual quantity allowed to a man<barker_pb n="670"/>
with a <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>if practicable, I should like to have it in a healthy
situation, to have some part of it extend to the <location_mentioned>river</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>writes
me that he will be situated near <location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>that is so near the <location_mentioned>Gulph</location_mentioned>,
that I should think it must be unhealthy, in many other respects I
should consider it preferable, particularly for commercial operations,
perhaps a situation<location_mentioned> on the Border of Galveston Bay</location_mentioned>, may be more
preferable for those purposes being easier I believe of access for 
vessels, and more <location_mentioned>contiguos to the United States</location_mentioned>, but my impression is
that there is a good deal of <location_mentioned>low marshy ground</location_mentioned> in that vicinity, 
besides the <person_mentioned>Galveston Bay Company</person_mentioned> appear to have arrogated to 
themselves, <location_mentioned>the whole of that Bay</location_mentioned>, which might subject a body to some
restrictions that would not be altogether agreeable—it puts me in
mind of the <location_mentioned>State of New York</location_mentioned> claiming jurisdiction over all the
<location_mentioned>navigable waters on the Jersey shore</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>this side of that state</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>To have some of that valuable live oak included in my <location_mentioned>farm</location_mentioned>, would
be very desirable as that must become very important sooner or later,
but I presume that is out of the question, for if I mistake not it is all
disposed of in another way. I should like to locate somewhere in
your <location_mentioned>neighborhood</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>writes me from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> that he would inform me,
when an oppy offered in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, by which I might get a living, it
would be strange if that oppy does not soon offer, in a <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>that
was so recently in Embryo, now possessing thousands of <person_mentioned>Inhabitants</person_mentioned>,
and a rush of population, setting that way unpresidented, of such a
variety of character and diversity of occupations, and represented to
possess so many superior advantages over any part of <location_mentioned>North America</location_mentioned>,
that I cannot but flatter myself, that I may benefit by a removal to it.</p>

<p>I should like some occupation when there, by way of variety and
relief from the toils of the plough, a reasonable proportion of the
time; as not having been in the habit for many years past of wielding
any instrument in the way of labour, more weighty than a Goose
quill, I fear my hands are too tender to follow the plough and hew
timber for a constancy, practice may bring them to a proper 
consistency.</p>

<p>I saw a letter <date_mentioned n="06-29-1831">last evening</date_mentioned> from one of the <person_mentioned>agents of the G. B. C°</person_mentioned>,
dated <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1831">last April </date_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, in which he speaks of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>on the
<location_mentioned>Trinity </location_mentioned>being very fine, but observes that it is superior <location_mentioned>on the border
of the Brazos</location_mentioned>, a good deal for them to allow.</p>

<p>As you calculated to be back in <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1831">May</date_mentioned>, I am flatering myself with
the pleasure of a letter soon announcing your safe return, if you
take the <location_mentioned>Leag of Land</location_mentioned> for me, let me know what the amount of 
expenses are as they accrue that I may remit the same, I think the time
is six years before the whole amount becomes due, a pretty long credit
however I suppose that depends on circumstances. I hope to be
with you <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1832">within the year from the date</date_mentioned>, cannot go immediately.<barker_pb n="671"/>
should like to be here when you make your visit this way, but do not
think you will be able to accomplish it, for several years yet.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>European powers</person_mentioned> are striving hard to prevent a general war
on the <location_mentioned>continent</location_mentioned>, and it looks at present as if they wood succeed
but it yet remains doubtful. The <person_mentioned>Poles </person_mentioned>fight desperately but must
be overpowered and subdued by the <person_mentioned>Russians </person_mentioned>unless assisted by some
<person_mentioned>European </person_mentioned>power, of which there appears no indication at present.
The <person_mentioned>Genl </person_mentioned>who went to <location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>from the<person_mentioned> Mexican Government</person_mentioned> for the
purpose of forming, or proposing a Treaty between the two 
<location_mentioned>countries </location_mentioned>had had an interview with the <person_mentioned>King</person_mentioned>, and by the last accounts
taken his passage at <location_mentioned>Bordeaux </location_mentioned>for <location_mentioned>Vera Vruz</location_mentioned>, where it is supposed
he is about this time, with the <person_mentioned>King</person_mentioned>s answer, and terms, on which
he is willing to accede to, to lay before his <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>which are thought to
be so favorable that a Treaty will soon be concluded. I understand
that it is probable one of the<location_mentioned> Ports of Mexico</location_mentioned> will be declared a <location_mentioned>free
port</location_mentioned> ere long. Please remember me particularly to <person_mentioned>Mr. and Mrs.
Perry </person_mentioned>who I presume are with you. I hope to receive a letter from
you soon telling me you returned safe in <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1831">May last</date_mentioned>, and your health
much improved.</p>
