*p*Austin to Mateo Ahumada, April 6, 1826. Quoting a report of April 4, by
Capt. Ross of the destruction of a party of marauding Tahuacanos.*/p*
*/div1*

*div1 type="body"*

*p*The *person_mentioned*Captain of the Militia of the *location_mentioned*Colorado District*/location_mentioned*, James J. Ross*/person_mentioned*,
transmitted to me the following report bearing date of the *date_mentioned n="04-04-1826">4th Instant*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*" In compliance with your orders of the *date_mentioned n="03-28-1824">28th of last March*/date_mentioned*, in which
you inform me that a party of *person_mentioned*Tahuacanos */person_mentioned*had left their *location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*
on their way to the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, under the pretext of looking for the
*person_mentioned*Tancahues*/person_mentioned*, and order me to watch and attack them if they should be
seen in this *location_mentioned*neighborhood*/location_mentioned*; I lost no time in sending *person_mentioned*spies */person_mentioned*to the
*location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, and *date_mentioned n="04-05-1826">yesterday*/date_mentioned*, at noon, I received information that sixteen
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*of said *location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*had arrived near the settler *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Asa Anderson*/person_mentioned*'s
house*/location_mentioned*, about *location_mentioned*five Leagues below the road to La Bahia*/location_mentioned* on this *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*.<barker_pb n="1305"/>
I collected the *person_mentioned*militia*/person_mentioned*, and by ten o'clock at night, I mustered 
thirty-one *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, with whom I marched eight Leagues, and attacked the 
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*at daybreak. It was not an easy matter to get at them in their
position; they were on a deep *location_mentioned*creek*/location_mentioned*, the banks of which are covered
with a dense thicket and chaparal, which induced me to divide my
*person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*into two parties. One *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*under the command of *person_mentioned*Lieutenant
Rawson Alley*/person_mentioned*, commenced the attack in front, from the bank of the
*location_mentioned*creek*/location_mentioned*, while I took position with the other *location_mentioned*in the bottom of the little
run*/location_mentioned*, above the place where the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were so as to be able to fire
on them when they crossed the *location_mentioned*creek*/location_mentioned*. This disposition had a good
effect. At the first fire of *person_mentioned*Alley's party,*/person_mentioned* the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*ran for the 
*location_mentioned*bottom*/location_mentioned*, and there received a volley from my party. Eight *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*fell
*person_mentioned*dead*/person_mentioned*, and five were *person_mentioned*wounded */person_mentioned*and escaped to the thicket. We took
five fire arms, seven bows, and a considerable number of arrows and
quantity of ammunition. The thickness of the *location_mentioned*Chaparal */location_mentioned*prevented
us from pursuing the *person_mentioned*fugitives*/person_mentioned*, who scattered in various directions.
There is sufficient reason to conclude, from the signs of blood and
other indications on their trails, that only three of the sixteen 
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*will ever reach their *location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*. Each *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*had a leather rope
and noose, and they were all on foot, having with them only one horse.
They were a portion of the *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*who, last fall, stole horses at the
*location_mentioned*Atascosito crossing*/location_mentioned* on this *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*. I found among their property
some papers which show that one of their dead was the *person_mentioned*chief called
Cordero*/person_mentioned*, and that two other *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*named *person_mentioned*Lisaque */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Guichupa */person_mentioned*were
killed. It affords me great satisfaction to be enabled to say that the
*person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*obeyed my orders with alacrity, and behaved well during the 
attack.    I send you herewith the papers I found."*/p*

*p*In consequence of this incident, I gave orders to the *person_mentioned*captains of
Militia*/person_mentioned* in this *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, to have their *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*ready at a moments notice;
and I would send spies to the*location_mentioned* *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*to watch their 
movements and ascertain their intentions. I apprehend no danger of an
attack on the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*by these *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*, as, according to information
I have received, the *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*destroyed by *person_mentioned*Captain Ross*/person_mentioned* was the only
one that visited this *location_mentioned*neighborhood */location_mentioned*for the purpose of stealing, and
the other *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*disapproved their conduct. I will leave today for
the *location_mentioned*upper road*/location_mentioned* from *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*; I may there receive 
information that will compel me to open a campaign against the *person_mentioned*Waco*/person_mentioned*
and *person_mentioned*Tahuacano */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*, in which case I shall report to you in due
season.*/p*

*p*Which I have the honor to report to you, enclosing the papers and
documents found in the possession of the routed party.*/p*
