	<barker_summary>Austin's draft of a bill to establish a seminary of learning, [October 11 1827?].</barker_summary>
	<barker_footnotes>The date of this document cannot be definitely fixed. The order for the establishment of the Ayuntamiento of San Felipe de Austin was issued by the Governor on
November 17, 1827, and promulgated by the political chief of Bexar on December 11
The election was held and the ayuntamiento organized February 10, 1828. Article 3 of
this document indicates that it was written before the establishment of the 
ayuntamiento. Between October 11 and November 8, 1827, Austin made, in Saltillo a series of
suggestions to the Governor for legislation. This document was most probably written
about that time, but it is not certain that it was presented to the Governor. Compare
it with a bill drawn April 30, 1831,</barker_footnotes>
