*p*To mention, generally, the *location_mentioned*wilderness state*/location_mentioned* in which *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*was at the time
of the Mexican independence—the difficulties, privations and hardships which
the *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*have undergone in settling this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*— The advantages
which the *location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*has gained, without the cost of one dollar by an augmentation
of physical force for the protection of the *location_mentioned*frontiers */location_mentioned*against hostile *person_mentioned*indians */person_mentioned*or
other *person_mentioned*enemies*/person_mentioned*, by the progress of agriculture and by the introduction into the
*location_mentioned*Mexican territory*/location_mentioned* of the culture of cotton as an article of exportation to *location_mentioned*foreign countries*/location_mentioned*, thus supplying a great staple commodity which may be recevd
along the*location_mentioned* whole coast, of the Gulf of Mexico*/location_mentioned*, in sufficient quantities to pay for
all the imports without the necessity of sending out one dollar The rich
products of the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*would then remain, and circulate freely through the
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*— It only needs a calculation of the annual produce of the *location_mentioned*mines*/location_mentioned*
for ten years to form an idea of what the wealth of *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*would be, even in
that time, if the agricultural productions, were sufficient to pay for the importations.*/p*
