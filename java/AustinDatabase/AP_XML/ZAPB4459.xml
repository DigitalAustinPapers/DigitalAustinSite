<p><location_mentioned>City of New York</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-25-1832">Octr 25. 1832</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Mr Dear Sir</p>

<p>I arrived here from <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="07-22-1832">22 July</date_mentioned> last at the height of
the prevailing epidemic; and found the <location_mentioned>City </location_mentioned>nearly abandoned and
all business virtually suspended. And it is only <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1832">within this month</date_mentioned>
that the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>have returned to their <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>and things
begin to assume their usual aspect. This information, which has
doubtless been partially anticipated, will account for the apparent
apathy in the <person_mentioned>land companies</person_mentioned>, for whose progress I had made 
arrangements. I am now here for the first time that an assemblage of
the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>could be had since the cholera, and in a few days they<barker_pb n="882"/>
will have organised their plans of operation, and go to work to
introduce <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>. It is more than probable I shall come on to
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>as early as practicable to fix <person_mentioned>resident agents</person_mentioned> on the <location_mentioned>respective
grants</location_mentioned>, and get the colonization fairly under way. But whether I
undertake this or not, it will not change my determination to visit
your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>this <date_mentioned n="Winter - 1832">winter</date_mentioned>; and I hope to see you at <location_mentioned>St. Felipe</location_mentioned> in
<date_mentioned n="12-xx-1832">December </date_mentioned>at farthest.</p>

<p>I am fully persuaded the <person_mentioned>Galveston company</person_mentioned> will go on with
spirit, and you may expect from them a full cooperation in all
your views. Your movements in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>I have learnt with no little
interest, and see you have taken the first step for a change in your
<person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>,—declaring in favor of a <location_mentioned>seperate State.</location_mentioned> This 
doubtless can be readily effected so soon as quiet is restored to the <location_mentioned>Republic</location_mentioned>.
The news here is that <person_mentioned>Bustamente </person_mentioned>has been completely routed by
<person_mentioned>Montesuma</person_mentioned>, and is a <person_mentioned>fugitive</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Padraza </person_mentioned>has returned, at the repeated
solicitation of<person_mentioned> Santa Anna</person_mentioned>, and by his resuming the Presidency will
end the contest and restore the constitution. We are on the eve of
our Presidential election, and <person_mentioned>Jackson </person_mentioned>must be reelected by an 
overwhelming <person_mentioned>majority</person_mentioned>. The goubernatorial elections of <location_mentioned>Ohio</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Keny</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>Pensa</location_mentioned>—have been <person_mentioned>Jackson</person_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>ohio </location_mentioned>by an immense <person_mentioned>majority</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I hope to see you when I visit your <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, because I have much
to say to you, and many important subjects to submit to your 
consideration deeply interesting to us both and to the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. Should
you return to<location_mentioned> Leona Vicario</location_mentioned> before I arrive or be absent leave a 
letter saying what will be your movements.</p>

<p>I think it more than probable you have been induced to forego
your inclination to retire from public life and will be found at the
<person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1833">January</date_mentioned>— much to my disappointment, it is said
that <person_mentioned>Bravo </person_mentioned>has been chosen <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>—should our old friend <person_mentioned>Graves</person_mentioned>
be with you assure him of my cordial remembrance, and accept for
yourself my most friendly regards</p>

<p><person_mentioned>John T. Mason</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. I sent your letter to <person_mentioned>Ed Hawes</person_mentioned> on my arrival: but have heard
nothing from him, I have not been in <location_mentioned>Keny</location_mentioned>. I hope the <person_mentioned>Governor</person_mentioned>
has appointed a <person_mentioned>commissioner </person_mentioned>for these <location_mentioned>grants</location_mentioned>: if not please have
it done as early as practicable. My expectation was you would 
return to <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>and have this done when there—-</p>

<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Colonel Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>St. Felipe de Austin Texas</location_mentioned></p>
