<p><location_mentioned>Cincinnati </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-18-1829">18 July 1829</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I received your very welcome favor of <date_mentioned n="05-29-1829">29 May</date_mentioned> but <date_mentioned n="07-17-1829">yesterday</date_mentioned>—it
came by mail from <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned> and I have not heard a Syllable of the
<person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>and his <person_mentioned>lovely Bride</person_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Major Lewis</person_mentioned> has this moment left
me and is on the wing for the <location_mentioned>Brasos </location_mentioned>I regret exceedingly that I
have not more time to devote to my <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>by this very
favorable opportunity— You mention having received one letter
and some <location_mentioned>newspapers </location_mentioned>why I have written a dozen or thereabouts
and sent as many packages of papers To <person_mentioned>League </person_mentioned>I have written
oftener and Sent more papers and I have not yet received one line
from him—- I hope the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Sovereigns </person_mentioned></hi>will be <hi rend="italic">divil </hi>him worse then
ever— he Is a Shabby fellow-
Have you heard of the terrible <person_mentioned>Havanna Armada</person_mentioned>— are you
prepared for it— I believe It is all Smoke or will end so— or
perhaps is designed as a Scare-crow to obtain a favorable 
commercial treaty privileges etc on condition of recognition—</p>

<p>I am fully sensible of the necessity of being In my <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>and
design to repair there as soon as practicable The late disturbance
at <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>gave me a verv serious back set from which it has been
difficult to recover— I had a very respectable <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>in full
progress of formation when the news of war and revolutions and
insurrections dispersed them like a hawk pouncing upon a flock of<barker_pb n="229"/>
pigeons . . . probably . . . [Torn] Short interval of repose has
been granted to the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>powers </hi>of <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>I pray that repose may be
continued to an age of ages—</p>

<p>You paid <person_mentioned>Buckner </person_mentioned>5$ more than you had <hi rend="italic">any right to do</hi>—and I
request <person_mentioned>League </person_mentioned>will refund you that much for I cannot allow my
<person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>to pay <hi rend="italic">for </hi>me, more than they owe to me and you have paid
5$ more than you owed—ergo, it must be returned.</p>

<p>I beg you will present to my estimable friend <person_mentioned>Brown</person_mentioned>, my warmest
congratulations on his <hi rend="italic">duplication </hi>and I sincerely hope the <person_mentioned>little
fellow</person_mentioned> may inherit all the beauty of his <person_mentioned>mother </person_mentioned>the goodness of
his <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>, the intelligence of his <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned>, and the immortality of the
blessed—</p>

<p>I hope <person_mentioned>Williams'little daughter </person_mentioned>will not put my little friend
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Vic</person_mentioned>'s </hi>nose out-of-joint, as the saying is— Remember me to <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>
and his <person_mentioned>wife</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Your letter has releived my mind of one very serious bother, for
I have suffered more inquietude concerning my little debt to friend
<person_mentioned>Buckner </person_mentioned>than it was worth— I am truly pleased to hear that the
<person_mentioned>Empresario </person_mentioned>has got into vogue with the <person_mentioned>sovereigns </person_mentioned>and the more so
because I Know how unpleasant it is to be subject even to the 
malicious and gratuitous censures of the stupid the vile and the unjust—
and I hope, as he has acquired, so he will preserve his popularity
with the mutation . . . [Torn off]</p>

<p>I expect most confidently to be in <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned>early in the <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1829">fall</date_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>Milam </person_mentioned>and myself are endeavoring to form a <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>for 
colonization and <hi rend="italic">mining </hi>purposes—and have a very fair prospect of 
Success—in getting the company—</p>

<p>I have not time to write to <person_mentioned>League </person_mentioned>without hazarding the loss of
the present very favorable oppy— Be good enough to tell him—if
he has any Surplus funds of mine, to transmit them by the first good
oppy to my friend <person_mentioned>James Loccard Com. Mercht at <location_mentioned>New Orleans </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>and
to request <person_mentioned>Loccard </person_mentioned>to remit them to me at this place provided they
reach him by the <date_mentioned n="10-01-1829">first of October</date_mentioned>— Remember me to all <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>-
May God bless you and give you prosperity here, and eternal felicity
hereafter—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>David G. Burnet  </person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>I have not heard from <person_mentioned>Fullerton</person_mentioned>, directly, in a long time—he is
still at <location_mentioned>Chillicothe</location_mentioned>—</p>
