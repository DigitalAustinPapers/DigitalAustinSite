*p**location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="04-18-1831">18th April 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Col. Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Leona Vicario</hi>*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dr Sir, Your favours of the *date_mentioned n="03-15-1831">15th ulto*/date_mentioned* and *date_mentioned n="04-19-1831">19th inst.*/date_mentioned* were duly 
received. The letters which you enclosed in the former, were 
transmitted to the *location_mentioned*U. States*/location_mentioned* in compliance with your request.*/p*

*p*It is truly gratifying to me, to learn, that there is yet, some 
prospect of defeating the Law; which the Hon. *person_mentioned*Legislature of your *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*
*/person_mentioned*has attempted to pass; prohibiting *person_mentioned*Foreigners */person_mentioned*from the privilege of
retailing their merchandise a copy of which, you did me the honor
to transmit—for your politeness and attention, I beg leave to return
you my sincere thanks. If such a law as contemplated, should go
into effect, it would most unquestionably, militate materially against
the interest of my *location_mentioned*countrymen*/location_mentioned*. Its practical operation would have
a similar tendency towards the *person_mentioned*natives */person_mentioned*generally. It would throw
the whole trade into the hands of a <hi rend="italic">few </hi>*person_mentioned*capitalists*/person_mentioned*; who, availing
themselves of the monopoly, could compel the *person_mentioned*consumers */person_mentioned*to pay
almost any price for their goods, that their consciences would permit
them to ask: in a few words it would benefit the few to the obvious
detriment of the <hi rend="italic">many</hi>. I have never understood that you was an
advocate of that law; nor has any such report been in circulation
here, your letter gave me the first report of its supposed existence.
The laudable effort made by your *person_mentioned*Legislature*/person_mentioned*, in behalf of this *location_mentioned*Port*/location_mentioned*,
will be duly appreciated by every *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*of equal rights and free
trade. It is to be hoped, that the open hostility, manifested by the
*person_mentioned*citizens of *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, against the growing prosperity of this section,
may be tranquilized; and that the interested selfish motives, disclosed
in their application to the *person_mentioned*General Congress*/person_mentioned* to close, the*location_mentioned* Port of
Matamoros */location_mentioned*may be responded to, in the language of denial.*/p*

*p*The natural advantages, which this place possesses, in point of
health, over the *location_mentioned*Southern Ports*/location_mentioned*; the superior facilities in the 
transportation of merchandise into the *location_mentioned*interior*/location_mentioned*; its contiguity to the
*location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, and to the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*.; and its importance as a *location_mentioned*military port*/location_mentioned*,
claim the consideration and protection of the general Government.
Those common advantages to the *location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*, should not be easily yielded
by those entrusted with its affairs; nor sacrificed by the cupidity of
local jealosy, and self-aggrandizement*/p*.<barker_pb n="648"/>

*p*I have been informed, from a *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*entitled to credit, that the
Commercial Treaty, concluded by the*person_mentioned* American Charge des Affaires
at Mexico,*/person_mentioned* with this *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, has been ratified by the *person_mentioned*Senate of
the *location_mentioned*U. States*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, that the *person_mentioned*American citizens*/person_mentioned* are placed upon an equal
footing with those of the most favored *location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*; and that the principle
of reciprocity has been fully recognized and established, by the 
respective *person_mentioned*Governments*/person_mentioned*.—by the next arrival I expect to receive that
document.*/p*

*p*The latest accounts from *location_mentioned*Europe*/location_mentioned*, represent the powers that be, in a
high state of excitement and commotion—A general war is 
anticipated on the *location_mentioned*Continent*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have been confined to my room, by severe indisposition, for some
months past; in consequence of which, I have not replied to your
communication of the *date_mentioned n="03-15-1831">15th ulto*/date_mentioned* until now, I herewith enclose you a
letter from *person_mentioned*capn Henry Austin*/person_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned*. He directed me to
enclose it under cover to some *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*, as he apprehended
there would be danger of its being intercepted in its progress, 
provided it went to your address. I have therefore enclosed it to *person_mentioned*Mr.
Judah*/person_mentioned*, an intelligent *person_mentioned*merchant */person_mentioned*of that place, and beg leave to 
recommend him to your particular attention and regard.*/p*
