*p*My dear Sir I wrote you a few lines by *person_mentioned*Mr: Jaques*/person_mentioned*, mentioning
my arrival: We are still entirely in an unsettled state; and I
therefore cannot do myself the pleasure to see you. I wrote you from
the *location_mentioned*U States*/location_mentioned* respecting my land business which I am satisfied your
goodness will have promptly attended to. I have now to ask you
agreeably to your promise, to send me a power to vote upon your two
shares of the *location_mentioned*Matagorda Town tract*/location_mentioned*. Let me ask you if you have
received your quota of the notes arising from the sale of the lots
thereof, as I understand there has been a division, tho' I have received
nothing. I should very much like to know when you start for
*location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*, tho' I hope you may deem it most advisable to remain this
season in your own *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Should *person_mentioned*Mr. Lesassier*/person_mentioned* not have sent me the money that I wrote for,
I wish you my Dear Sir to urge him on the subject, as it is absolutely
essential I should have it.*/p*
