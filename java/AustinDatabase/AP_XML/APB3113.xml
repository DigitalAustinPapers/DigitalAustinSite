*p*I observed, that in Your *person_mentioned*Lordship*/person_mentioned*'s letter of the *date_mentioned n="11-14-1826">14th*/date_mentioned* Instant, in
answer to my communication relative to the interpretation of the
law of *date_mentioned n="09-29-1823">September the 29th, 1823*/date_mentioned*, and *date_mentioned n="03-20-1824">March the 20th, 1824*/date_mentioned*, You say
that "I have declared in favor of the interested *person_mentioned*party*/person_mentioned*, representing
imperatively, and as if I had authority, etc."*/p*

*p*I beg that Your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*will allow me, as an explanation of my
intention, to say, that I never will declare in favor of any one who
would oppose the law or *person_mentioned*authorities of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and if some expressions are found in my communication that may display assumption, they did not correctly convey my idea: probably owing to my
imperfect knowledge of the language, I have made use of some words
the meaning of which is stronger that I supposed it to be. My object was to urge the Ayuntamiento to submit the doubts that seemed
to exist as to the correct interpretation of the law of *date_mentioned n="03-20-1824">March the 20th,
1824*/date_mentioned*, to the proper authority, for my own information, and not with
the view to make a representation in regard to *person_mentioned*De Witt*/person_mentioned*'s particular
case.*/p*

*p*I feel much interest, and I am anxious to see the most perfect harmony prevailing between the*person_mentioned* old and new residents*/person_mentioned*, but I take the<barker_pb n="1511"/>
part of no one in particular; and I hope that Your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*will
attribute no expression contained in my communication to assumption; but, on the contrary, to my wish to settle an important doubt
in regard to the rights and privileges conferred on the *person_mentioned*people of
*location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned* */person_mentioned*by the law of *date_mentioned n="09-29-1823">September the 29th, 1823*/date_mentioned*. Being myself a component part of these *person_mentioned*people*/person_mentioned*, I cannot help opposing that which in
my opinion, is obnoxious to, or restrictive of these privileges.*/p*
