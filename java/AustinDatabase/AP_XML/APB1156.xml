join in war on Tahuacanos, Wacoes, and other tribes. Reports of hostile

*div1 type="body"*
*p*In my communication of the *date_mentioned n="05-08-1826">8th Instant*/date_mentioned*, I reported to you my 
situation in relation to hostile movements against the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*, and
informed you that I had sent *person_mentioned*spies */person_mentioned*in various directions to watch the
*person_mentioned*Indian party*/person_mentioned* whom we had reason to believe had left their *location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*
on their way to these *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, in the meantime, the contemplated
*person_mentioned*expedition */person_mentioned*remaining suspended. On the *date_mentioned n="05-13-1826">13th Instant*/date_mentioned*, the express
I had dispatched to the *person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*returned with a letter signed by
*person_mentioned*Captains Fields*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Bowles*/person_mentioned*, and other principal *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*of this *person_mentioned*tribe*/person_mentioned*,
in which they stated to me, that after a secret council held among
them, they unanimously agreed to march with all their *person_mentioned*forces */person_mentioned*and
attack the *person_mentioned*Wacoes*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes */person_mentioned*and other *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*at war with the
*person_mentioned*Mexicans*/person_mentioned*, and that they were ready to assist the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*of this 
*location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, if the government ordered them to do so; but in consequence
of the lated freshets of the *location_mentioned*Neches */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned*, and of almost all
the *location_mentioned*streams */location_mentioned*in that section of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and, also owing to the
backwardness of their crops, they could not do so immediately. The
*person_mentioned*express */person_mentioned*I had sent is an intelligent and trusty *person_mentioned*man*/person_mentioned*, whom I had 
instructed not to show my letters to the *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*before he could 
ascertain their intentions and views on the subject. He is well acquainted
with the *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*and several *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*of that tribe. He remained
among them four days, and tells me that he has not the least doubt
but that the *person_mentioned*chiefs */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*warriors */person_mentioned*are anxious to go to war; as well
against the *person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Comanches*/person_mentioned*, as the petty thieving
*person_mentioned*Quincháis*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Ainais*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Apadache*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Coco */person_mentioned*and other *person_mentioned*tribes */person_mentioned*who live in their
vicinity. All those *person_mentioned*tribes */person_mentioned*are friendly with the *person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes*/person_mentioned*, and I
believe their destruction to be very important for the common 
security. The *person_mentioned*express */person_mentioned*also reports that on the *location_mentioned*Neches river*/location_mentioned* he met an
old *person_mentioned*Apadache Chief*/person_mentioned*, whom he had known at *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*; that he
told the *person_mentioned*chief */person_mentioned*he was still living there, and that the *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned*of
that locality were very bad; his design being to draw from him his
opinion of us. The *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*replied that the *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned*of the 
*location_mentioned*Colorado */location_mentioned*were very bad: that they had killed some of his *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*the
*person_mentioned*Tehuacanoes */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Quichais*/person_mentioned*; that all the *person_mentioned*small tribes*/person_mentioned* in that part of
the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*were about to hold a great council called by the 
*person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes*/person_mentioned*, for the purpose of taking measures to destroy the new 
*location_mentioned*settlements */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*west of the Trinity*/location_mentioned*, and that the *person_mentioned*Comanches */person_mentioned*were invited to
attend. He did not say when, or where the meeting was to take
place, and he declared that the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*East of the Trinity*/location_mentioned* were good
*person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*brothers*/person_mentioned*. He said, also, that the *person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes */person_mentioned*had sent
word to the *person_mentioned*traders */person_mentioned*who traffic with the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*on the *location_mentioned*Sabine River*/location_mentioned*.
that they would give a good horse for ten musket loads of powder
and lead, and a good mule for twenty loads.   On his arrival at the<barker_pb n="1339"/>
*location_mentioned*crossing of the Trinity*/location_mentioned*, the *person_mentioned*express */person_mentioned*received information from the
*person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*there, either *person_mentioned*Americans*/person_mentioned*, or *person_mentioned*Spaniards*/person_mentioned*, that they had seen
the day previous, five *person_mentioned*Quichais */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Ainai Indian*/person_mentioned*, who secretely told
the *person_mentioned*Spaniards */person_mentioned*that 200 *person_mentioned*warriors */person_mentioned*of the *person_mentioned*small tribes */person_mentioned*would shortly 
attack the *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*on the Brazos */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, but that the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*
*location_mentioned*East of the Trinity*/location_mentioned* were *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*brothers*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*militia of the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* detailed for the contemplated campaign
were all ready, a part of them being encamped here; others on the
*location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, at the *location_mentioned*fort */location_mentioned*they have erected *location_mentioned*between the roads to *location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned*
and Atascosito*/location_mentioned*; and the balance on the *location_mentioned*Brazos */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*near the road to
Bexar*/location_mentioned*; mustering in the aggregate, 100 *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned**/p*.

*p*The *person_mentioned*spies */person_mentioned*referred to in my communication of the *date_mentioned n="05-08-1826">8,th Instant*/date_mentioned* have
seen no signs of the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*supposed to have left their *location_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*for
these *location_mentioned*settlements*/location_mentioned*; and, as I have already stated to you, I considered
myself prevented, by your order of the *date_mentioned n="05-04-1826">4th Instant*/date_mentioned*, from carrying
on the campaign. However, on the return of the *person_mentioned*express */person_mentioned*with the
above mentioned information, I felt convinced of the absolute 
necessity to order out a *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*to watch over the *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, inasmuch as
the *person_mentioned*militia */person_mentioned*were very impatient to meet the *person_mentioned*enemy*/person_mentioned*. Therefore,
under the impulse of protective considerations, I ordered the*person_mentioned* senior
Captain*/person_mentioned* of the *person_mentioned*battalion */person_mentioned*who was to take command in my absence,
agreeably to the seventh article of the Militia Regulations, to proceed
with the *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*to the *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*above the road to Bexar, on the Brazos,*/location_mentioned*
leaving a detachment in the *location_mentioned*fort */location_mentioned*on the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, to protect this
*location_mentioned*section*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I gave general instructions to this *person_mentioned*officer (Captain A. C. Buckner)*/person_mentioned*
to keep a good lookout all along the *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, and particularly for
the 200 *person_mentioned*warriors*/person_mentioned*, who, I have reason to believe are coming from the
*location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned*to join the *person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes*/person_mentioned*; and to attack any hostile *person_mentioned*parties of Indians */person_mentioned*wherever our protection rendered it necessary, and 
circumstances permitted. I hope you will not consider this step at variance
with your orders of the *date_mentioned n="05-04-1826">4th Instant*/date_mentioned* for the suspension of the hostile
movements against the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*. Circumstances rendering it 
absolutely necessary for our defence The *person_mentioned*Captain */person_mentioned*Commanding the
*person_mentioned*Militia */person_mentioned*may, possibly, be compelled to attack the *location_mentioned*Indian Villages*/location_mentioned*, as
there is some probability, if the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*are aware of the movements
of the *person_mentioned*Militia*/person_mentioned*, that they will leave their *location_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*should the attack be postponed to the month of *date_mentioned n="07-xx-1826">July*/date_mentioned*. For it is impossible to assemble
*person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, as scattered as our *person_mentioned*militia */person_mentioned*are, without a few days notice; 
consequently, secrecy cannot be preserved in such cases, every one having
to settle his business and make preparations previous to a march.
Any *person_mentioned*traveller */person_mentioned*can perceive these movements among the *person_mentioned*militia*/person_mentioned*, and
there is not a day but some are passing on their way to *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*.
Should anv of them mention it there, the news would soon reach the<barker_pb n="1340"/>
*person_mentioned*Quichais*/person_mentioned*, or other of those mean thieving *person_mentioned*tribes */person_mentioned*that live in that
*location_mentioned*neighborhood*/location_mentioned*. In case that an attack on the *location_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*might affect the movements referred to in your communication of the *date_mentioned n="05-04-1826">4th Instant*/date_mentioned*, I
will transmit to you any report so soon as it reaches me. *person_mentioned*Captain
Buckner*/person_mentioned* and his command will start *location_mentioned*from their encampment on the
Bexar road*/location_mentioned* on the *date_mentioned n="05-22-1826">22nd Instant*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have given secret instructions to a very reliable and intelligent
man, who left us a few days since for the *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned*, to indirectly
ascertain the disposition and views of the *person_mentioned*Cushate */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Alabama
Indians*/person_mentioned*; and, also, to find out the feeling of the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*in that 
*location_mentioned*section*/location_mentioned*, and the numbers of *person_mentioned*militia */person_mentioned*men that could be obtained from
them in an emergency. I have no doubt that orders from you and
the *person_mentioned*Political Chief to the Indians*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*militia*/person_mentioned*, will induce them to
join me in the war.
