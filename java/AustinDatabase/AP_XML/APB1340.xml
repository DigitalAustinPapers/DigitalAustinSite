*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I expected to have started *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*this day, but *person_mentioned*Ahumada */person_mentioned*has 
determined to visit the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*as far as to the Sabine*/location_mentioned* and insists on
my accompanying him. I go with great reluctance for my thoughts
and feelings are all in the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*and I am heartily tired of this
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*It is perhaps a fortunate thing for me that I have learned patience
in the hard School of an *person_mentioned*Empresario */person_mentioned*for I assure you that in this
*location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*I have had full use for all I possessed Things are all settled
here and I think tranquility is fully and firmly established but;
matters were in a dreadfull and a critical situation, and nothing
but the greatest prudence has prevented the most serious 
disturbances—*person_mentioned*Gains */person_mentioned*and a few *person_mentioned*others */person_mentioned*blamed *person_mentioned*Ahumada */person_mentioned*and me, and me
in particular for the course I have advised, but I have a 
consolation that to me is worth more than the approbation of any man,—
in the consciousness that I have done right—*person_mentioned*Fields */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*are
certainly killed by the *person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*and all the other *person_mentioned*leaders */person_mentioned*of the
*person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*have escaped over the *location_mentioned*Sabine */location_mentioned*and I advised a mild course
with those who were compromitted in a secondary degree and
*person_mentioned*Ahumada */person_mentioned*himself was in favor of such a course and adopted it<barker_pb n="1611"/>
and for this a few *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*here blame me, but they are but few, for
the whole *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*in general are gratified, and the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*
character stands higher here now than it ever did before—I hope the
*person_mentioned*people of the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*will be satisfied with me for next to the 
approbation of my own conscience, theirs is worth more to me than all the
world beside.*/p*

*p*How comes the *location_mentioned*Garden*/location_mentioned*? remember me to *person_mentioned*Mrs. Calvit*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Mrs.
Long*/person_mentioned*, has the promise which you was called on to witness been
complied with? if it has not you may tell that man to prepare for
the worst—I have been very unwell with a cold and am several
ounces lighter than when I started—remember me to *person_mentioned*Mrs. Picket
*/person_mentioned*1 would write to her but this is the last scrap of paper I have or
can get remember me to my friend *person_mentioned*Westall */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Pettus*/person_mentioned*
and *person_mentioned*Mrs. Cummins*/person_mentioned* and all others—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Col. Milam*/person_mentioned* send their best respects to *person_mentioned*Mrs. Long*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*old Gefe*/person_mentioned* and myself have appointed the *date_mentioned n="03-15-1827">15 of this month*/date_mentioned*
to start home and I hope to be with you in all this month.*/p*

*p*War between *location_mentioned*England */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Spain */location_mentioned*and cotton looking up a little.*/p*

*p*You cant imagine my anxiety to get *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*and had I not 
promised *person_mentioned*Ahumada */person_mentioned*to go to the *location_mentioned*Sabine */location_mentioned*with him on our first arrival
here I would start for *location_mentioned*San Felipe */location_mentioned*tomorrow, don't neglect to touch
up Mr. . . . [sic] about his promise. My feelings are deeply 
interested in that business and he shall do what he has promised and
perhaps a good deal more that I mean to make him do—I will stop
least I may go to bed in a bad humor for it is past 12 at night so
I bid you good night*/p*
