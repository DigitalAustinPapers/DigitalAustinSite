*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I feel disposed Sir to try to advance your interests in colonising
your *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*and for this purpose would advise your sending me
specific terms at length, which you grant to *person_mentioned*Settlers */person_mentioned*containing also
a fuller description of the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*its face, health, situation, 
productions local advantages and the kind of *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*already there, their
religion, whether all sects are tolerated there, if there is any 
established religion of the Government and how it is supported. I 
applied to *person_mentioned*Mr Tanner*/person_mentioned* as you requested respecting publishing a map of
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*to which he acceded eagerly. He said that he would be at all
the expense of engr[aving] and publishing and [furnish] you with
a certain number of copies to be hereafter agreed upon. He 
supposed that as *location_mentioned*Coahuila */location_mentioned*was a part of the province of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*you meant
to include that.   I could not answer this*/p*.

*p*I have just seen *person_mentioned*Mr Tanner*/person_mentioned* and he thinks the *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*should be about
45 by 33 inches and advises your laying it down on that scale He
says he could not allow you more than a dozen copies for yourself
as he must rely considerably on the sale by you to disburse the
expenses. Not being willing to delay writing you any longer and
being about to set off on a Journey *date_mentioned n="05-09-1828">tomorrow*/date_mentioned*, I am compelled to
be brief in this   *   *    **/p*
