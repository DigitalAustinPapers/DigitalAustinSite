*p**location_mentioned*Brazoria*/location_mentioned*, *date_mentioned n="01-25-1833">Jany 25th 1833*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear Sir—*/p*

*p*Your favr of the *date_mentioned n="01-22-1833">22nd inst*/date_mentioned*. by *person_mentioned*Maj. Reynolds*/person_mentioned* was handed to me
*date_mentioned n="01-24-1833">last evening*/date_mentioned*, and I have a convenient opportunity to reply. I
must thank you for the hints, that that as well as the one previous,
contained; and assure you I have valued your counsel in all instances
very highly, and have never disregarded it if it did not correspond
fully with my own judgment for I have been able to allow your
knowledge and Experience their proper weight in matters where
they render you more competent to decide than I could for a moment
presume myself—and I have never been made to doubt the 
correctness of your motives. I must,therefore insist that you let no occasion
pass to afford me the benefits of your advice, for if I do not strictly
adhere to it, rest assured it will be always a guide. I have a task
of much difficulty and great responsibility to perform, and am<barker_pb n="920"/>
destitute of aid or counsel but that I receive from you. The politics
of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, as you justly remark, are in rather a tangled 
condition, and that very circumstance makes my track more difficult to
discern; for how to preserve consistency with some settled system oí
opinions, when there is not a standard by which those who are
actually managing the machinery, are guided, is a source which
furnishes matter to Exercise the ingenuity even of an Experienced
diplomatist, rather than to Employ the raw and unskilful hand that
is literally compelled to wield it alone.*/p*

*p*For the sake of appearing united, and by that very means 
producing union, I have Endeavoured to give to Every measure broached
and acted upon in a way that it might have an influence on the main
current of our affairs, such a face as would not disgrace us by 
Exposing our situation, agitated with dissention, and rendered 
contemptible by division and inconsistency. It has been my leading wish, to
Keep up a belief of unanimity on all important points, and to bring
as large a volume of the *person_mentioned*public */person_mentioned*mind to the support of whatever
course the *person_mentioned*Central Committee*/person_mentioned* should adopt, as it would be possible
to do. This idea is very material abroad, and is the only foundation
of confidence intertained of the redemption of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—if 
smothered or rendered doubtful, the population of the country will be
checked, and all its hopes darkened. You say the tone of my *location_mentioned*paper*/location_mentioned*
has been rather anti *person_mentioned*Mexican*/person_mentioned*, and that I ought to change it. I do
not think I have said any thing that should wound them as a
people—on the contrary I have when speaking of the *person_mentioned*liberal party
*/person_mentioned*always puffed them. To be sure I have not said much about them,
for I know too little to Enable me [to] say any thing in their favour,
that would not be inconsistent with our own acts and declarations.
As to the mere tone of the *location_mentioned*paper*/location_mentioned*, it is not so Easy to change without
the detection of inconsistency as might be thought. The tone of the
*location_mentioned*paper */location_mentioned*has been caught from, and formed by the events that have
occured, and the circumstances and necessary feelings which surround
us—and some occurence or new event must serve as a hinge upon
which to turn even the tone of <hi rend="italic">my </hi>remarks from the general tenor
of our conduct. If <hi rend="italic">communications </hi>were introduced not too much
varying in substance from the drift of the public feeling, or the 
expectation, or rather belief of what that is, abroad, invested with such
a glossy colouring of true and loyal Mexicanism as to answer the
purpose you desire, I could yield better to that, than to no obvious
cause, in departing from what has at least appeared to Chime with
the united feelings of the people. I dropt you a few hasty remarks
a day or two since, in reply to your letter by *person_mentioned*Bradly */person_mentioned*which with these,
will inform you how I feel disposed on the subject of our politics.
Without consistency we have no influence-—Without influence we
can do no good.*/p*<barker_pb n="921"/>

*p**person_mentioned*Grayson */person_mentioned*has not yet come, but I have reason to expect him every
week. *person_mentioned*Dr. Archer*/person_mentioned* is *location_mentioned*at the mouth of the river */location_mentioned*on a health 
expedition. I hope they "may be of some use to us in the work we have
before us, as you suggest.*/p*

*p*In relation to the correction of the proof sheets of the 
Remonstrance, I have to answer that you will either have to come down
for that purpose, or leave it to me and *person_mentioned*Cotton*/person_mentioned*, for *person_mentioned*Eckle */person_mentioned*is sick.
The translation cannot be well made here, and I shall therefore
expect the one you made. Wherefore do you wish it copied? your
hand writing is very plain.*/p*

*p*When shall I come up on the subject of land ? or will it be 
necessary at all. I shall send my *person_mentioned*brother */person_mentioned*up before the *person_mentioned*Commissioner*/person_mentioned*
leaves—I have two here just from the *location_mentioned*College walls*/location_mentioned*, and will make
useful Citizens of them by learning them to print a little—You must
give them a piece of land, for that was the promise upon which they
came. On the subject of *person_mentioned*P Green*/person_mentioned*, he wishes to know, if a petition
could not be sent down to him to sign which would answer the 
purpose without his presence?*/p*
