without any serious accidents considering the distance and the number
of our *person_mentioned*famaly */person_mentioned*togather with the Season of the year we came in we

and a number of deaths in this place since we arived here, all of
which ware *person_mentioned*strangers */person_mentioned*and mostly men and it is thought by many
that most of them might have recovered if they had been properly
attended to in the first stage of the disease but being *person_mentioned*strangers */person_mentioned*ware
necessaryly compelled to stop at*location_mentioned* public houses*/location_mentioned* where they could not
have that attention paid to them which was necessary. I promised
to write to you my oppinion of this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and the prospects as I
have been here so short a time I can give but verry little more light on
the subject than heretofore my oppinion is about as when I first
visited the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*the soil and climit is here and all that is wanting
is industry and enterprise togathere with a well regulated and
perminent Government to make this *location_mentioned*one of the most desirous parts
of the wourld*/location_mentioned* I have ever seen I have made an excursion of two weeks
looking for a situation to fix ourselves on. I was down*location_mentioned* on the coast
*/location_mentioned*I now expect to start in a few days to look at *location_mentioned*some of the country
above here*/location_mentioned*, before I decide where to reside the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*above here
is verry much extold by those residing there but I am prety much
determined to settle *location_mentioned*near the Coast*/location_mentioned* *location_mentioned*within a few miles of the West
end of Galvesten bay*/location_mentioned*, and as soon as I determine on the place will
start with all my force to put up some *location_mentioned*cabbins */location_mentioned*to move my *person_mentioned*famaly*/person_mentioned*
to. they will remain at this place until we can get some place for to
live in and in one year after I get to farming I will be better able
to give you my oppinion of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, but for the present I would
not advise any of my *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*acquantence */person_mentioned*to move to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
without first coming to see it and judge for themselves before I left
the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*I requested you to pay my last years Tax but whether I
gave you any writen memorandon to that effect I dont recollect but
I hope you have and if not I wish you to do so I also wish you to get
me out of*person_mentioned* Scotts administrator*/person_mentioned* as soon as posible and we have several
smalle accts which wish to send you but have had no time as yet to
