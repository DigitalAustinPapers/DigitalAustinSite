*p*Dr Sir. I reed, your esteemed favor of *date_mentioned n="03-01-1833">1 ult.*/date_mentioned* recommending *person_mentioned*Doctor
Spaulding*/person_mentioned*   It will give me great pleasure to do any thing in my<barker_pb n="941"/>
power to promote the views of the *person_mentioned*Docter*/person_mentioned*.   He stoped at *location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned*
and I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing him.*/p*

*p*It is highly gratifying to me that you and *person_mentioned*Mr. Sanders*/person_mentioned* approve
of my conduct in relation to the settlement of the business of our
mutual friend *person_mentioned*J. H. Hawkins' estate*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*After the many years of labor and hardships and perplexities I
have undergone in this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*by which I have secured a handsome
fortune for the *person_mentioned*heirs*/person_mentioned*, I was not prepared to receive censure from any
of them, because I thought that I did not merit it. *person_mentioned*Edmund*/person_mentioned*, I fear,
received incorrect impressions from some persons who are unfriendly
to me, but I think they are removed now and that he is very well
satisfied*/p*.

*p*It would be gratifying for me to receive assurances from *person_mentioned*Mr. Haws*/person_mentioned*,
and from *person_mentioned*Geo. N. Hawkins*/person_mentioned* that they were satisfied with the 
settlement and with my conduct I have always viewed *person_mentioned*J. H. Hawkins*/person_mentioned*
more like a brother than any thing else. I am however well aware
that it is very difficult for persons at a distance, who live in a well
organised *location_mentioned*community */location_mentioned*to form a correct idea of the trouble, or labor,
or difficulties of doing business in this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*of the kind I have been
engaged in.*/p*

*p*Your approbation is very gratifying indeed for I prise your
opinions very highly.*/p*

*p*I am endeavoring to close all my affairs and totally withdraw 
myself from public matters or <hi rend="italic">politics</hi>—it is not so easy to do, as at first
appeard.*/p*

*p*Our convention has met and will no doubt apply to the*person_mentioned* national
congress */person_mentioned*for the admission of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*into the *location_mentioned*mexican union */location_mentioned*as a *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*.
I think the application will be granted. I believe it is very necessary
to save this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*from ruin. We are now able to sustain A *person_mentioned*State
Govt*/person_mentioned*, and no *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*ever required one more than this.*/p*
