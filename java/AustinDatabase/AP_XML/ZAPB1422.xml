<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe De Austin</location_mentioned>   <date_mentioned n="06-27-1827">June 27th 1827</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr Penrose</person_mentioned> respectfully presents to <person_mentioned>Col. Austin</person_mentioned>, the following
subjects for his consideration, and on which he would request an
answer, whenever the <person_mentioned>Col's</person_mentioned> convenience will permit—</p>

<p>1st <person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>— in conjunction with a <person_mentioned>planter of Louisiana</person_mentioned>, proposes
erecting in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, an extensive <location_mentioned>Distillery </location_mentioned>for the manufactory of
Rum, but as the law " Granting certain privileges to the <person_mentioned>Citizens
of Texas</person_mentioned> " under which <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>— would expect to import Melasses for
the maintainance of his <location_mentioned>Distillery</location_mentioned>, appears to clash with a 
subsequent law of the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned> to place the matter beyond a doubt
would solicit from the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, the privilege of introducing from
<location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>or elsewhere, an adequate supply of melasses, for a Term
of years, free of duty, or untill the <person_mentioned>Citizens of the Colony</person_mentioned> who have
turned their attention to the culture of the sugar cane, could afford
the material in sufficient abundance, when <person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>— would pledge
himself to confine his purchases to the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>—The capital which
<person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>— would invest in the prosecution of his design, would be
little short of $10,000 and as the greatest part of that sum would
be expended in the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>—and as the <location_mentioned>houses </location_mentioned>and other fixtures
when erected, would be an important and valuable acquisition to
the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>— would therefore, solicit the cooperation of <person_mentioned>Col
Austin</person_mentioned> in obtaining the privilege refered to. Should the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned>
grant <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>— the privilege of introducing Free of duty—one 
hundred thousand Gallons of Melasses, annually he would also suggest
to <person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned>, the reasonableness of his asking an exclusive privi-<barker_pb n="1664"/>
lege. <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>— would invest a large capital in a doubtful adventure,
he stakes his all, with his time and attention for years—and should
ultimate success, or entire ruin to himself, be the result of his 
enterprise, he conceives himself meriting the encouragement and 
protection of the Govt for introducing a manufactory heretofore 
unknown, or pursued upon a very limited scale—</p>

<p>2nd What quantity of <location_mentioned>Land</location_mentioned>—might <person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>—expect to derive from
the Govt as a donation and where situated ?—</p>

<p>3rd <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>— is particularly solicitous to be informed by <person_mentioned>Co1 Austin</person_mentioned>
of the various markets of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—What quantity of Rum could
be annually disposed of, in each place, and the probable price, and
also the safest and cheapest means of transportation to the <location_mentioned>interior</location_mentioned>?</p>

<p>4th   Whether 1st or 4th proofs would meet the readiest markets?</p>

<p>5th If <person_mentioned>Co1 Austin</person_mentioned> is of opinion that some point on the <location_mentioned>Brassos</location_mentioned>,
would be the most eligable position for the proposed establishment—
<person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned> would request him to designate the place, having a regard to
the facility of transportation to the various ports of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>6th <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>— would require for his establishment, a large quantity
of scantling and Cypruss plank, but as the latter cannot be easily
obtained in the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned>—would wish to get permission to
bring from <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned>—Cisterns ready made, or plank for the 
purpose of making them—</p>

<p>7th Could <person_mentioned>artizans </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>day laborers</person_mentioned> be obtained in the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>
or would <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned> have to bring them from <location_mentioned>U—S</location_mentioned>?</p>

<p>8th Are not the <location_mentioned>banks of the Brassos</location_mentioned> well wooded, and if so, what
kind of timber is generally found?</p>

<p>9th Should <person_mentioned>Mr P—</person_mentioned> find it necessary to purchase a vessel, what
tonage would <person_mentioned>Co1 Austin</person_mentioned> recommend ? and what steps would <person_mentioned>Mr P</person_mentioned>—
have to pursue, to place his vessel under the <location_mentioned>Mexican </location_mentioned>Flag—</p>

<p>10th What is the regular army of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—and what number of
<person_mentioned>Seamen</person_mentioned>? how are they provissioned? might not<person_mentioned> Mr P</person_mentioned> dispose of a
considerable quantity of Spirits annually—to the Govt for their
<person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>navy</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Should the privilege solicited—be granted, it will be in the name
of <person_mentioned>Joseph B. Wilkinson and Clement B Penrose</person_mentioned>, Trading under the
name of <person_mentioned>Penrose & Co</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Would it not be profitable to establich a <location_mentioned>sugar house</location_mentioned>?</p>

<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>The foregoing memorandum I have hastily sketched out, there are
other objects connected with my plan, which I will discuss with you
when your liesure will permit; in the meantime the only apologys I
can offer for the trouble I give you, is the assurance of my warm
thanks for the friendly reception which you have given me—and to
remind you of the friendship which has so long subsisted between<barker_pb n="1665"/>
our <person_mentioned>Families</person_mentioned>—I must also trouble you to enquire for me at <location_mentioned>San
Antonio</location_mentioned> the price of 1st rate cognac Brandy and Annisette cordials—
I have of the first upwards of 100 Gals, and of the latter, say
240 Gals,,—put up in casks of 12 Galls—if it is not too much trouble
you might possibly dispose of it, for me, deliverable here to some of
the <person_mentioned>traders </person_mentioned>of that place, I presume it is worth, from 3 to 4$ per
Gallon—will you My Dear Sir, at all events, write to me, as early
as your convenience will admit of,</p>

<p>If I have to go to <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>—I conceive the cheapest way,
would be to employ mules—but as they are not to be had here I have
to request, as a particular favor, that you would send them in—I
will require ten—and <person_mentioned>Mr McKinstry</person_mentioned> who will accompany me will
want eight more—and also two horses to ride—will you when you
write inform me whether Dry Goods are abundant or scarce in <location_mentioned>San
Antonio</location_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr. McKinstry</person_mentioned>'s prospects in going there. I shall not
want the mules until I hear from you—If what I ask should in the
least interfere with your convenience, I beg you will tell me so 
without ceremony—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>C. B. Penrose</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. S F Austin</person_mentioned></p>
