could carry thirty odd barrels   this vessel had four *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*on board*/location_mentioned*

Robroy arive *person_mentioned*Mr Duncan*/person_mentioned* applied to *person_mentioned*Fields */person_mentioned*and My self to assist him
to get his recked property, we readily agreed and as soon as the
*person_mentioned*chicken thief company*/person_mentioned* found that out they started immediately and

when they returned with the property they refused to give the *person_mentioned*owner*/person_mentioned*
any part thereof   they soon herd my opinion of such conduct and
they removed to *person_mentioned*Mr, Bradley*/person_mentioned*s, this conduct raised the feelings of
several of the *person_mentioned*citizens */person_mentioned*who happened to be here and some of the
 *person_mentioned*pasengers */person_mentioned*of the Robroy and when those *person_mentioned*plunderers */person_mentioned*found the people

up half the property that *person_mentioned*Duncan */person_mentioned*proved to be his and refused to

or he mus leave my premicies for I could not admit of having it
made a rendevouse for *person_mentioned*pirates   */person_mentioned*he took the hint and has moved

consideration the situation of this place and send on men clothed
with the proper authority and Means of protecting the honest part
of society and expelling those abandoned *person_mentioned*wretches */person_mentioned*who would suck
