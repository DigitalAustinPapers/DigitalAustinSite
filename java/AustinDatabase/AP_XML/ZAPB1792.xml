<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-17-1829">Nov 17. 1829</date_mentioned></p>
<p<person_mentioned>>Mr John Durst</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Nacogdoches</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir I have recd your letter by this days mail dated the <date_mentioned n="11-10-1829">10th
instant,</date_mentioned> on the subject of the decree of the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>freeing all the
<person_mentioned>Slaves</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>You say to me in your letter "in the name of God what shall we
do.— do for God's sake advise me on the subject by return of mail,
we are ruined for ever should this measure be adopted "</p>

<p>What the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>have to do, is to represent to the 
<person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, through the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamientos </person_mentioned>or some other channel, in a very
respectful manner; that agreeably to the constitution, and the 
colonization laws <hi rend="italic">all </hi>their <person_mentioned>property </person_mentioned>is guaranteed to them without 
exceptions in the most solemn and sacred manner-— That they brought
their <person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>property into the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and have retained it here,
under the faith of that guarantee, and in consequence of a special
invitation publically given to <person_mentioned>emigrants </person_mentioned>by the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>in the
Colonizacion law to do so—that they have taken an oath to defend<barker_pb n="289"/>
the constitution and are bound to do so. That the constitution of
the <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>expressly recognises the right of property in <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned>, by
allowing six months after its publication for their introduction into
the <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>—That they <hi rend="italic">will </hi>defend it, and with it, their <person_mentioned>property</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>There ought to be no vocifirous and visionary excitement or noise
about this matter— Our course is a very plain one—calmn, 
deliberate dispationate, inflexible, <hi rend="italic">firmness</hi>; and not windy and ridiculous
blowing and wild threats, and much less any thing like opposition
to the <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>constitution, nothing of this kind will do any good,
it will in fact be unjustifiable, and will never be approved of by me
but on the contrary opposed most decidedly. I will <hi rend="italic">not </hi>violate my
duty as a <person_mentioned>mexican citizen</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The constitution must be both our shield, and our arms, under it,
and with <hi rend="italic">it </hi>we must constitutionally defend <person_mentioned>ourselves </person_mentioned>and our
<person_mentioned>property</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>chief of department Dn Ramon Musquiz,</person_mentioned> has taken a firm
and noble stand, he has suspended the publication of said decree,
and has represented in a very able manner against it. If he should
finally be compelled to publish and circulate it, the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamientos</person_mentioned>
must <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, take an unanimous, firm, and <hi rend="italic">constitutional </hi>stand. The
people will unanimously support them.</p>

<p>I know nothing of the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>who compose the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamiento </person_mentioned>of
<location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, if they are true <person_mentioned>patriots</person_mentioned>, and true <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>to themselves
and to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, they will not suffer that decree to be published or 
circulated in that <location_mentioned>municipality </location_mentioned>and they will take the stand I have
indicated or some other that will preserve the constitution and our
constitutional rights from open and direct violation</p>

<p>These are my ideas on the matter. I have said the same to my
<person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, and when the decree arrives officially (which it has
not yet) I shall say the same to the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>—What I do in this matter
will be done openly—<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>has not within its whole <location_mentioned>dominions</location_mentioned>
a man who would defend its independence, the union of its 
<location_mentioned>territory</location_mentioned>, and all its constitutional rights sooner than I would, or be more
ready and willing to discharge his duties as a <person_mentioned>Mexican citizen</person_mentioned>; one
of the first and most sacred of those duties is to protect my 
constitutional rights and I will do it, so far as I am able. I am the
owner of one <person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>only, an old decreped <person_mentioned>woman </person_mentioned>not worth much,
but in this matter I should feel that my constitutional rights as
a <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>were just as much infringed as they would be if I had
a thousand, it is the principle and not the amount, the latter makes
the violation more agravated, but not more illegal or 
unconstitutional</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin  </person_mentioned>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>P. S.   Let me know what your <person_mentioned>Ayto</person_mentioned>. will do—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A </person_mentioned>  [Rubric]</p>
