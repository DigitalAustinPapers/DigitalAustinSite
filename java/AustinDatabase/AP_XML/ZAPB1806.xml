<p><location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="12-04-1829">4 Decr 1829<</date_mentioned>/p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>The return of our worthy <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Genl Fullerton</person_mentioned> affords me
another opportunity of troubling you with a letter— Well now
I do verily believe that some of my late letters have been a trouble
to you—but I dont see the use of having a <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>unless we can
trouble him now and then-—</p>

<p>The principal burden of my last letters (and I have written you
five or six within two months) has been the probable purchase of<barker_pb n="297"/>
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by this <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>— This subject has somewhat died away
here and the excitement produced by its first agitation in the <location_mentioned>public
papers</location_mentioned> has measurably subsided— The <location_mentioned>newspaper </location_mentioned>discussion of it
was I believe first Started by <person_mentioned>T. H. Benton</person_mentioned> whom you know—
Some <person_mentioned>writer </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>rung the second peal, and anon the matter
was taken up by a variety of <person_mentioned>scribblers</person_mentioned>, both <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>foes </person_mentioned>to the
contemplated acquisition— My original opinion, as expressed to you
in my first letter on the subject, has been somewhat modified but
not essentially changed— I still believe the purchase will be made,
but not so speedily as I then apprehended— It seems to me that
<person_mentioned>Mr Poinsett</person_mentioned> has rendered himself too much an object of jealousy,
and become too unpopular in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>to negocíate a treaty on so
delicate and important a subject as the relinquishment and the 
acquisition of so valuable a <location_mentioned>territory</location_mentioned>— Rumor says that <person_mentioned>Mr Hughes</person_mentioned>,
who was recently superseded as <person_mentioned>charge d'affairs at the <location_mentioned>Netherlands</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>will be appointed to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and I think the report very likely to
be correct—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Hughes</person_mentioned> is now in <location_mentioned>Europe </location_mentioned>and probably will not arrive in this
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>before spring— Should he be sent to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, he could not
reach there until late in the <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1829">fall</date_mentioned>, for he would not venture himself
at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> during the <date_mentioned n="Summer -1829">summer </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1829">autumnal </date_mentioned>months— If then it
shall fall to his lot to negotiate the treaty, it will not be practicable
for him to perfect it until late in the ensuing <date_mentioned n="Winter - 1829">winter</date_mentioned>, and hardly in
time to submit it to the <person_mentioned>senate </person_mentioned>of <date_mentioned n="1830-1831">1830-31</date_mentioned>— It will doubtless be
a part of the policy of the <person_mentioned>administration </person_mentioned>to bring it in before the
sages of the land, near the close of their session when the ranks of
the <person_mentioned>opposition </person_mentioned>may be a little thinned and those who remain are
pretty well fagged and out of tune for a fierce onset— It is 
therefore not probable in my opinion that you will belong to <person_mentioned>Uncle
Sam</person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">before </hi><date_mentioned n="03-xx-1831">March </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1831">April of 1831</date_mentioned>—and I do really hope that I
shall be able before that time, to have my <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>fully Settled and
so firmly fixed as not to be disturbed by the arch cupidity that has
too often characterised our good <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Uncle's </person_mentioned></hi>dealing with <person_mentioned>large land
claimants</person_mentioned>— I have but little time to write, but I send you a packet
of <location_mentioned>news papers</location_mentioned> from which you will [be] able to glean more of the
late doings in the <location_mentioned>world </location_mentioned>than I could give you in a week— I 
observed in one of the <location_mentioned>national Journals</location_mentioned> which I send you, a letter
from <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> touching the <location_mentioned>advertisment </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>Dennis A Smith</person_mentioned>
of 48,000,000 of acres of <location_mentioned>Texas lands</location_mentioned>— I was truly rejoiced to see
that <location_mentioned>publication</location_mentioned>— They have an <location_mentioned>agency </location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">here </hi>and when it was
first established I was detirmined to expose the imposition as I then
considered it by a <location_mentioned>publication </location_mentioned>under my own proper name— The
<person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>here called on me on the subject and I stated to him very
frankly my views concerning it and told him that I should feel com-<barker_pb n="298"/>
pelled if they put out an <location_mentioned>advertisement</location_mentioned>, to enlighten the public
mind on the matter— He assured me that no money should be
paid over to the alleged <person_mentioned>proprietors </person_mentioned>until they gave entire 
satisfaction as to title— I then concluded not to interfere and make
myself many <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>for I have learned from experience that 
<person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>made in this way have much more zeal, than any <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>whom
the doing of Such a service might procure a body— so I even
resolved not to meddle with the matter, but I have freely spoken of
it to many <person_mentioned>gentlemen in this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and have communicated my views
to two respectable <person_mentioned>citizens of <location_mentioned>Baltimore</location_mentioned>—
</person_mentioned></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Peck</hi>, who left here a few days ago for <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, tells me that
<person_mentioned>Willson </person_mentioned>is selling <location_mentioned>Texas lands</location_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> at 2 cents an acre—
<person_mentioned>Willson </person_mentioned>told me last <date_mentioned n="Summer - 1829">summer</date_mentioned>, that he had a <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">in fee</hi> for 8,000,000
acres— Is it so qu[i]en sabe, as we <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>say— Certain I am
that these things are doing an injury to all of us—- the detection of
one fraud in relation to <location_mentioned>Texas lands</location_mentioned>, will entail suspicion upon us
all, and it is outrageous that honest <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>should suffer for the 
misdeeds of a few <person_mentioned>sharpers</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have some expectation of forming a <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Baltimore </location_mentioned>for
the settlement of my <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>— Should it be done we shall 
proceed rapidly in the work—a few weeks will determine— I am
exceedingly desirous to get back— Should our friend <person_mentioned>Padilla </person_mentioned>be
with you I beg you will mention me to him—- I wrote to him and
also to the <person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>some time ago and enclosed my letters to
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and I hope they have not miscarried— I have since then
written to the <person_mentioned>Governor</person_mentioned>, inclosed to you, and sent a duplicate I
would write to both by this opportunity but have not much time
and am not yet able to speak positively as to my success or my return
to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I received a <location_mentioned>nacogdoches paper</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="12-03-1829">yesterday </date_mentioned>containing an obituary
notice of your amiable and lamented <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>and I have taken [it]
to the <location_mentioned>Gazette office</location_mentioned> to have it published here— It occurred to me
that there might be some <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>relatives </person_mentioned>who had not heard
of his decease, and besides it would be a gratification to my own
feelings to give currency to that modest tribute of respect for the
memory of a <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>whom I much esteemed—</p>

<p>I send a half barrel of buck wheat meal directed to <person_mentioned>League</person_mentioned>, to be
divided between <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and himself— Should you be at 
house-keeping you must make a tripartite division of it, for I have sent
it under a presumption that you <hi rend="italic">were not</hi>— My <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
are so frugal of their time or their paper that I am left entirely to
presumptions on all matters relating to them— The <hi rend="italic">one </hi>letter from
you and one from <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>are all the evidence I have
that I am remembered on the <location_mentioned>Brasos</location_mentioned>—   I have never received one<barker_pb n="299"/>
line from <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>League</person_mentioned></hi>— I beg you will write to me by the first opportunity as it is probable I shall be here long enough to receive it if
not here, will have it Sent after me— do write any how and give
me all the news, for I am exceedingly in the dark in respect to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
affairs— Farewell— May God bless you in all things— 
Remember me to all <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>—and should you have opportunity remember
me particularly to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Long</person_mentioned>— I heard long ago that she had left
<location_mentioned>San Felipe </location_mentioned>and was living <location_mentioned>on the river below</location_mentioned> and therefore have
not mentioned her in my former letters—in haste.<p>
