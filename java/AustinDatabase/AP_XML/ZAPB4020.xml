<p><location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="09-05-1830">5 Sept 1830</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>From some cause or other we were Eight weeks without any of the
<location_mentioned>news papers from your Colony</location_mentioned>, or any inteligence from there; 
during that interval, some one arrived here from <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned>, who reported
that he had seen some person there direct from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, who said you
was dead, and that it was generally believed in <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned>, this gave
me much anxiety, until a few days since, I was agreeably relieved
from this state of suspence, by the receipt of six of the<location_mentioned> Texas 
Gazettes</location_mentioned>, by the <person_mentioned>Editor of the Journal of Commerce</person_mentioned> by the same mail,
up to the <date_mentioned n="07-12-1830">12 July,</date_mentioned> which he sent me, and a <location_mentioned>new Orleans paper</location_mentioned>  
containing an article from one of your papers as late as the <date_mentioned n="07-22-1830">22 July</date_mentioned>, by
which I observed you were recommended as one to represent your
<location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, to the Legislature, you having written to me, that your
health was impared by the fatigue you had encountered, caused me
to feel very apprehensive that the report might be correct— I 
considered it a very hard case, that just as you were commencing to
reap and enjoy the benefits of your great exertions, that you should
be taken off, and your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>left to revert to its original nugatory
state-— Thank God the report proved false, and that you were yet
alive, and I hope may live many many years, and be fully compensated 
for the many deprivations, you have been subject to, in the<barker_pb n="477"/>
enjoyment of seeing your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>marching on with rappid strides,
untill it reaches the sumit of your most ardent anticipations—</p>

<p>I wrote to my friend <person_mentioned>Gildemeister </person_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="07-xx-1830">July last</date_mentioned> a very particular
letter, in which I discribed such good qualities of your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, as I
was acquainted with, stated the low price of the land, the 
inducements held out by the <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>Government to <person_mentioned>Swiss </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>German</person_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>Emigrants</person_mentioned>, and urged him, to endeavor to prevail on some of the
most capable, and inteligent to visit it, and judge for themselves of
the qualities, and advantages of the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>,— I recommended them
going direct to <location_mentioned>New Orleans,</location_mentioned> so as to arrive there in the healthy 
season, and that on enquiry of your <person_mentioned>agent Mr. Breedlove</person_mentioned>, or the 
<person_mentioned>Mexican Consul</person_mentioned>, the proper way would be pointed out to them to reach
your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>— I learnt that he had a <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>in Business in <location_mentioned>Bremen</location_mentioned>
to whose care I directed my letter, therefore presume there is no
doubt but he will get it, and I hope will be able to do the needful—</p>

<p>From that state of quietness, and almost torpor in which the
world was slumbering for such a length of time, we are now electrified
from day to day with the wonderful commotions, and rappid
succession of important events, with which <location_mentioned>Europe </location_mentioned>in particular
has been convulsed within a year past, such as the <location_mentioned>Crescent </location_mentioned>having
succumbed to the <person_mentioned>Russian </person_mentioned>Eagle, by which <location_mentioned>the passage to the Black
sea </location_mentioned>is thrown open, a commercial Treaty concluded by this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>
with the <person_mentioned>Sultan</person_mentioned>, of the <person_mentioned>Port[e],—the Dey of Algears</person_mentioned> submitting to
the arms of <location_mentioned>France</location_mentioned>, and his <location_mentioned>piratical City,</location_mentioned> the <location_mentioned>Blue Beard </location_mentioned>for so
many years of all <location_mentioned>Europe</location_mentioned>, stormed and taken possession of in a
few hours, and what is most wonderful, and much more important
a revolution in <location_mentioned>France</location_mentioned>, of four days existence causing a tyrannical
<person_mentioned>King (Chas the X</person_mentioned>) to abdicate his <location_mentioned>throne</location_mentioned>, and run off, it is 
supposed to join as worthy a <person_mentioned>King </person_mentioned>as himself <person_mentioned>Ferdinand</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Spain</location_mentioned>,
the<location_mentioned> streets of Paris</location_mentioned> deluged with blood, and the whole <person_mentioned>Empire </person_mentioned>in
commotion, a regency formed, the <person_mentioned>Duke of Orleans</person_mentioned> placed at the
head of it,<person_mentioned> La Fayette</person_mentioned> at the head of 80,000<person_mentioned> National Troops</person_mentioned>, 
quietness again restored, joy, and congratulations through out the
<location_mentioned>Metropolis</location_mentioned>, causing wonder, and even approbation in <location_mentioned>England</location_mentioned>., and
universal delight in this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>it is thought will follow next, and speedily, see the article
from the <location_mentioned>Madrid papers</location_mentioned>, in the paper which I inclose, which paper
contains the particulars of the recent revolution in <location_mentioned>France</location_mentioned>, which
may reach you by the regular mail first, should this packet not have
a short passage— The Independence of the late <location_mentioned>Spanish Colonies</location_mentioned>
in <location_mentioned>South American</location_mentioned>, it is thought will soon be acknowledged by
<location_mentioned>Spain</location_mentioned>—   We had accounts from <location_mentioned>Venezuella </location_mentioned>yesterday by an arrival<barker_pb n="478"/>
from <location_mentioned>Porto Cavello</location_mentioned> in 18 days passage, all quiet there, and the <person_mentioned>Capt</person_mentioned>
tells me that the <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>had decided on tolorating all religions,
a very important step, what a wonderful advantage it would be to
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, if they would do the same, they had also forbidden all
<person_mentioned>foreign Merchants</person_mentioned> doing business in their own name, except from
those countries which had acknowledged their Independence—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Mexican Minister</person_mentioned> is at present in this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>, he was in our
<location_mentioned>office </location_mentioned>yesterday, I hope his visit to this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, will impress him,
with favorable ideas in regard to our Government, Institutions,
Customs etc, and that he will be able to transmit the good effects
of them home— <person_mentioned>Mr. Treat</person_mentioned> the Brother of the Gentleman who
made you a visit some time ago, is appointed, <location_mentioned>vice consul in this
City, for Mexico</location_mentioned>, he is a particular <person_mentioned>friend of Henrys </person_mentioned>I had the
pleasure of passing part of an evening with the one who was with
you, (a few evenings since, and had some interesting conversation
with him, relative to your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, and he promised to call, and
pass an evening with me, but left <location_mentioned>Town</location_mentioned>, without doing so, he had
not positively decided on returning to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but thought it 
probable he should, and if he goes I think he said it would be in <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1831">October
next</date_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Mr. Prentiss</person_mentioned> called on me the other day to request a loan
of your pamphlet, he tells me he is appointed the <person_mentioned>Agent </person_mentioned>to sell the
<location_mentioned>Tract of Land, adjoining yours that was granted to <person_mentioned>Dr. 
[Woodbury?] </person_mentioned></location_mentioned>whose <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>I wrote you some ume ago, was going to see
you, to consult you about it, cannot recollect his name at this
moment—</p>

<p>I saw by the <location_mentioned>Texas Gazette</location_mentioned> the sloop Nelson advertised for this
place and saw her reported as having arrived in the <location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>,
I think, but she does not make her appearance yet, I hope she may
come as I hope to hear from you by her, and I suppose <person_mentioned>Mr John
Austin</person_mentioned> will come in her as I have heard he was also coming this
way, if he comes I shall calculate to hear a great many particulars
about <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I hope they have not suffered by the tremendious
Gales, that have caused so many disasters lately-— There was a
letter received here a few days ago from <location_mentioned>Matamoras</location_mentioned>, stating that
<person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>was going to your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>with his Steam Boat— we wait
anxiously to know if it is correct, it is a long time since any letters
have been received here from him,- it was reported that there
was a vessel to leave <location_mentioned>Matamoras </location_mentioned>about the <date_mentioned n="07-12-1830">12 July</date_mentioned>, for this place,
by which he may have written, but she has not made her appearance
yet— If he had of gone there, in his individual capacity, some
time since, you could probably have pointed out to him, a way of
doing something to advantage, ere this, while I fear the <person_mentioned>Del Norte
Enterprise</person_mentioned>, is a going to result unfavorably, poor fellow he has<barker_pb n="479"/>
traversed the <location_mentioned>world</location_mentioned>, beat the Bush, in every <location_mentioned>Hemisphere</location_mentioned>, contended
with almost unexampled perseverance, with the freaks of fortune,
had a fortune at various times as it were in his grasp, and have
frustrated, Blocade, Wars and peace have so intervened as [to]
distroy his well founded hopes of success, the all powerful ingine
Steam does not appear to enable him to stem the current that has
set against him, should he have gone or go to your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, I will
yet hope, that there is some good fortune in store for him—</p>

<p>I have been pondering in my mind what I could do to benefit my
situation, and it has occurred to me that I might establish myself in
<location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> to advantage, if I could through your aid obtain a
reasonable proportion of the products of your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>(such as are
suit to that place for sale) would it be consistent with your 
arrangements, to give me the agency of your Business there, and could you
prevail on those <person_mentioned>colonists</person_mentioned>, or any part of those who are turning
their attention to Sugar and Cotton to consign those articles to me,
I presume there is no great quantity produced at present, but it
will increase every year and must ultimately become very important
these Ideas have suggested themselves to my mind, and should like
to hear your opinion on the subject, perhaps I may find some one
here who has capital, to join me, or if you can suggest anything
better will thank you to point it out I am tired of dredging for a
mere salary, but am afraid to give that up until I can find some
thing that promises better— <person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>should be with you tell him
his <person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>are all well at <location_mentioned>New Haven<</location_mentioned>/p>
<p>yours very affectionately</p>

<p><person_mentioned>A. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p><date_mentioned n="09-08-1830">8 Septr,</date_mentioned></p>
<p>No further news from <location_mentioned>Europe</location_mentioned>, people are very impatient for
further intelligence to know what kind of a <person_mentioned>Genl </person_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>French </person_mentioned>people
decide on, and whether the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>generally acquiese in the measures
that may have been adopted in the <location_mentioned>Capital</location_mentioned>—and what the other
powers on the <location_mentioned>continent </location_mentioned>say to it— We have had several roomers
that the <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>Government had assented to the opening the<location_mentioned> West
India ports</location_mentioned> to our Trade, but they proved premature— The 
Negotiations on that subject are said to have been broken off, until the
ceremony was over in burying the <person_mentioned>King</person_mentioned>,—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Colo Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>,<location_mentioned> Sn Filepe de Austin   Texas</location_mentioned></p>
