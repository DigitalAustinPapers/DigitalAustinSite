<p>Sire having understood you wished to have the opinion of the
<person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>we give it as our opinion it is requisit to treat with them for
these are the same <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>[Karankaway] that <person_mentioned>Captain Jones</person_mentioned> fired
on and they have never solicited peace until now they say they are
tired of war and the conduct of them induces us to believe they are
in earnest for they have encamped in our <location_mentioned>stock range</location_mentioned> and have disturbed nothing to our knowledge—-also the <location_mentioned>upper settlement</location_mentioned> not
having it in their power to aid us and we not being able to protect
our selves we think it is proper to treat with them these are the
conditions that we wish you to treat on to secure <person_mentioned>hostages </person_mentioned>to not
permit over three to cum to geather to one <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>— it is our wish
you should cum and treat with them as well as thees—</p>
