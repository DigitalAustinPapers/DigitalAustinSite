*p*As this leaves me so may it find you enjoying the blessing of good
health—I have been much disappointed in my expectations at *location_mentioned*New
Orleans*/location_mentioned* in consequence of *person_mentioned*Jesse Thompson*/person_mentioned* not meeting me there
agreeable to contract I advanced him money to pay for his *location_mentioned*lands*/location_mentioned*
before he left this and he was to let me have the cash in *location_mentioned*Orleans*/location_mentioned*
with which I calculated to buy a set of salt kettles—the vessel also
being in debt more than I expected it was seized and sold and I
was not able to releave it but waited from day to day for *person_mentioned*Thompson*/person_mentioned*
to come on and let me have money but to my great mortification
he never arive[d] an old acquaintance of mine bought the sloop and
let us have it to get *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*
