land and to ascertain from you if there was a possibility of doing
so whether you intended letting him have land or not and where I
saw a letter you wrote him sum time since saying, as well as I
recollect that if he would recall sum expression or perhaps sum
letter he had written you that you would give him an answer on the<barker_pb n="1231"/>
subject of land business I believe I have seen all he has ever written
you and I do not recollect wherein he has written anything to you
but what he was justifyable in And as for his recalling that which
he ought not to do I do not consider it a fair request and my advice
to him would be not to recall any thing he has written or said unless
he has written or said that which he ought not to have done for it
[is] too tough for a man to do that which does not accord with his
conscience*/p*
