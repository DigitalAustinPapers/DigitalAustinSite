*p*Dear Sir According to your request I have made every inquiry
in regard to the Boats. One of the Boats that I calculated for the
Trip I found on Examination was worm Eaten I employed *person_mentioned*Bloodgood */person_mentioned*to put new planks on her Bottom but after all some of her timbers was found to be decad consequently I got *person_mentioned*Col Knight*/person_mentioned* to go to
*location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned* after a N Boat that was new *date_mentioned n="Spring - 1825">last Spring*/date_mentioned*, and also to call
on *person_mentioned*Wilson*/person_mentioned* on *location_mentioned*San Jacinto*/location_mentioned* who has a good Boat but will want some
repairs. *person_mentioned*Mr. Scott*/person_mentioned* has a boat that will answer the purpose, he says
that he cannot let her go. Since I recd your letter the Sloop Mexican
came to this place and I have purchased her. you mentioned that you
wanted to get a Sloop or Schooner of Light draft of water. She
when loaded will draw 3 feet 3 inches and a first Rate Sailer. I
will furnish a good *person_mentioned*master */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Crew */person_mentioned*provisions etc etc for one
Hundred and Thirty five Dollars pr month, and be at the expense of
keeping every thing in good repair. I expect *person_mentioned*Knight*/person_mentioned* in a few days
from *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned*, and then I can let you know what Situation the Boats
will be in. If you conclude to hire the Sloop Mexican, please to let
me know by the first opportunity*/p*
