*p*Dear sir My acquaintance with your general character, (though I
have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance, having seen you
only a few times while at *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*William Stevenson*/person_mentioned*s*/location_mentioned* in *location_mentioned*mount prairies*/location_mentioned*) and
the high station you hold in the land in which you live induces me to
hope for success on the present occasion*/p*

*p*A man by the name of *person_mentioned*Ruben McHaws*/person_mentioned* has swindled me out of
about $250,00 by tradeing me sundry forged notes of his own 
manufactory on *person_mentioned*citizens */person_mentioned*that I knew to be good; the precise amount is
$242,25   two *person_mentioned*negro fellows*/person_mentioned* one belonging to *person_mentioned*Mr John Johnson*/person_mentioned* the <barker_pb n="1207"/>other to *person_mentioned*Saml Hopson*/person_mentioned* has recently run away—*person_mentioned*Hopsons Negro*/person_mentioned* was
taken up makeing his way to your *location_mentioned*province */location_mentioned*and is of opinion the other
perished *location_mentioned*in the woods*/location_mentioned* I have not heard that he has ever been found
and says that *person_mentioned*McHaws*/person_mentioned* persuaded them to run away I made every
exersion to catch the *person_mentioned*vilian*/person_mentioned*, but finally failed; and the only hope I
now have of detecting him, is in your concern for my interest from
the merits of the case: You need have no apprehension of the 
existance of my *location_mentioned*claim */location_mentioned*which is coroborated by the accompanied affidavit
*person_mentioned*McHaws*/person_mentioned* is of Moderate size with blue eyes and balld headed, And
will perhaps pass through your dominions in the character of a
*person_mentioned*pedler*/person_mentioned*: Now sir if it be consistent with your authority to destrain
his effects in order to secure me you will do me a favour never to be
forgotten and I would be glad if you would write me immediately on the subject I feel the more anxiety on the occasion as this is a large
amount for me, in my situation, to loose: And I do declare upon
honour that I am able to establish the above accounts to all intents
and purposes*/p*

*p*We have nothing of import; you have heard no doubt that the 
*person_mentioned*Chactaws*/person_mentioned* will shortly posses our *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and many of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*
talk of moveing to your *location_mentioned*province */location_mentioned*I intend so soon as my business
will admit paying your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*a visit and if I like to locate there.*/p*
