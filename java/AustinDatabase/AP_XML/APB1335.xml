*p*[The Nacogdoches Insurgents were] treated with a degree of
lenity by the *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned*they had no right to expect from the nature
of their crimes—and which I will vouchsafe would not have been
shewn them in their *location_mentioned*native country*/location_mentioned* for similar offences—As to the
*person_mentioned*indians */person_mentioned*it appears that in place of *person_mentioned*twenty three tribes*/person_mentioned*, having joined
the *person_mentioned*Fredonians */person_mentioned*only a small portion of the <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*</hi>immediately
under the influence of*person_mentioned* <hi rend="italic">Fields </hi>*/person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*had entered into the 
*person_mentioned*alliance*/person_mentioned*, and they together with the *person_mentioned*Chief */person_mentioned*have fled for safety to the
*location_mentioned*other side of the Sabine*/location_mentioned*—The ballance of the *person_mentioned*tribes */person_mentioned*in this section
of the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*are expected here in *date_mentioned n="02-25-1827">two or three days*/date_mentioned* when I hope a
final adjustment of *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*affairs will take place—Inclosed I send
you a copy of two addresses one from *location_mentioned*Stephen */location_mentioned*to the *person_mentioned*Colonists*/person_mentioned*—and
the other from*person_mentioned* Benjamin Edwards*/person_mentioned* to the same, perhaps they will
not be inserted in any of the gacettes of *location_mentioned*Missouri*/location_mentioned*. I am fearful the
late disturbance will put a temporary check to emigration.*/p*

*p*I find by letter we received from *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned* a few days since that
all hope of recovering the *location_mentioned*Mine Au Burton estate*/location_mentioned* is over—I did hope.<barker_pb n="1606"/>
that we should have been enabled to have recovered it, but for [my]
part I am satisfied,—as a few years will place us in a situation (in a
pecuniary point of view) far different from what we have been—
Report says this Valuable *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*is about to be ceded to the
*location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*.—some are of opinion that it is already— I know this much—
during my last visit to *person_mentioned*Saltillo */person_mentioned*a *person_mentioned*Mexican gentleman*/person_mentioned* informed me
that previous to his leaving *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*—a proposal had been made by
*person_mentioned*Mr Poinsett*/person_mentioned* to purchase this *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*as far as the <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Rio Grande*/location_mentioned*</hi> his
proposition was not acceded to on the part of this Govt, but it is
supposed another proposition was since made which has been acceded
to—Should this take place (which in my opinion will sooner or later)
We would not take less than $500-000 for our interest in this
*location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*—a private letter from *person_mentioned*Mr Poinsett*/person_mentioned* states that the claims of
*person_mentioned*Empresarios */person_mentioned*who have complyed with their contracts will be
respected— Give my respects to *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned*, and kiss the *person_mentioned*little ones*/person_mentioned*
*person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*sends his love—We expect to leave this in a few days for
the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*—do write me often—I have not seen a letter from you
for something more than one year.—*/p*
