<p><location_mentioned>Mine a Burton</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-12-1825">October 12th 1825</date_mentioned>—</p>
<p>I wrote My Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned> by the last weeks Mail, and now imbrace the opportunity of sending you a small Packit by <person_mentioned>Mr Ray</person_mentioned> which I hope you will receive in safety as I have sent on a number of letters belonging to you and <person_mentioned>Brown</person_mentioned>, which I thought would afford you some pleasure, to peruse once more:—</p>

<p>Since I wrote to you I have seen <person_mentioned>Mr Carr</person_mentioned> and I had a conversation with him relative to the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned> business, he is very much dissatisfyed with the conduct of <person_mentioned>C. Ashley Esqr</person_mentioned> when that gentlemen was up <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1825">last Fall</date_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Mr Carr</person_mentioned>, with difficulty got him to give him a statement of what he had done with the <location_mentioned>property</location_mentioned>, it seems that he has got everything into possession, and has sold property to the amount of 3 or 4000 Dollars; he made one Sail to <person_mentioned>William Russel</person_mentioned> for eighteen hundred Dollars, and still continues to sell, as fast as he can, I think if their was <hi rend="italic">any-one</hi> that would push, or make an attempt to investigate the business, that <person_mentioned>Ashley</person_mentioned> would compromise, rather than have himself exposed to the world; it is impossible for <person_mentioned>Mr Perry</person_mentioned> to do any thing, situated as he is at present; and I think My Dear <person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned> if you were to write to some of your <person_mentioned>Friends </person_mentioned>at the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned>, and try to make them interested in some way, that, their might yet be something more recovered for the <person_mentioned>Children</person_mentioned>— at any rate I can do nothing and I am very much afraid that <person_mentioned>Ashley</person_mentioned> will be the only one benefitted by that property; I have nothing to write, but what <person_mentioned>Mr. Ray</person_mentioned> can inform you, as to the news of the times etc he can <barker_pb n="1222"/>
give you an account of all the <person_mentioned>Children</person_mentioned> as I showed them all to him; and I have also sent you a lock of each of their hair and some of Mine, all of which I think will be acceptable to you; for I know that any <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> highly <hi rend="italic">praised by me</hi>; do write by every opportunity, I have not had a letter for some time, from <person_mentioned>Brown</person_mentioned>, he is a very Lazy Fellow to write; but perhaps my anxiety makes me unreasonable, I think if you were to give <person_mentioned>Mr. Perry</person_mentioned> the least <hi rend="italic">encouragement</hi> he would go <hi rend="italic">on</hi> and <hi rend="italic">visit you</hi>; for he is much dissatisfied with
this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, and some times taulks of going to the <location_mentioned>Arkansas</location_mentioned>; my only desire is to be settled by my <person_mentioned>Brothers</person_mentioned>, if that was once accomplished I should be happy—</p>

<p>I read to <person_mentioned>Miss Hord</person_mentioned> the clause in your letter, she laughed and requested me to inform you that it was not customary for <person_mentioned>Laydes </person_mentioned>to go
in search of <person_mentioned>Husbands </person_mentioned>and that she expected if some of those <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Bachelors</person_mentioned></hi> that you spoke of, was to visit a <location_mentioned> Burton</location_mentioned>; that she had no doubt but what they could find <hi rend="italic">wives</hi>,—- I should be much pleased to hear that <person_mentioned>Brown</person_mentioned> was Married he promised me that as soon as he Married that he would pay me a visit— <person_mentioned>Cousin Adeline Lewis</person_mentioned> has a
<person_mentioned>Daughter</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Miss Eliza Elliott</person_mentioned> is to be Married to <person_mentioned>Mr. Woodruf</person_mentioned>, living at the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned>, where <person_mentioned>Miss Elliott</person_mentioned> now is— I have sent you a packit. . . .</p>
