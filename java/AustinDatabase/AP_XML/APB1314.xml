*p*My dear *person_mentioned*Judge*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*After a lapse of several years since our first and only acquaintance
took place, and altho we have never since that time corresponded
with each other—on my part I have often turned my memory to
scenes and events in which you were a party concerned; and have
carefully noted the progress of your arduous and responsible 
undertaking with feelings anxious for your complete and full success.
I have had the pleasure several times of reading letters from you
to our common acquaintance *person_mentioned*Colo Erwin*/person_mentioned*—in which you have 
somewhat in detail given a history of the progress of your *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, your
views, prospects, etc and I feel well assured from my knowledge
of you that you will realize all you have anticipated.*/p*

*p*My principal reason for addressing you at this time—is, to take
the liberty of introducing to your *person_mentioned*acquaintance */person_mentioned*my acquaintance
and *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned**person_mentioned*Colo Benjamin F. Foster*/person_mentioned*, who will hand you this. *person_mentioned*Col°
Foster*/person_mentioned* is a young *person_mentioned*gentleman */person_mentioned*of high character and respectability
in this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*both on his own account, and the numerous respectable
*person_mentioned*connexions */person_mentioned*he has here. He has been selected by the *person_mentioned*Texas 
Association*/person_mentioned* of this place to go out to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*as their *person_mentioned*agent*/person_mentioned*, for the 
purpose of procuring *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*on the *location_mentioned*land granted to them by the 
*person_mentioned*Mexican Government*/person_mentioned* */location_mentioned*and make such other arrangements as will tend to
the benefit of the *person_mentioned*company*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*A young man and a *person_mentioned*stranger*/person_mentioned*—*location_mentioned*in a foreign land*/location_mentioned*—he will no doubt
be much assisted by the *person_mentioned*council */person_mentioned*and advice which you my dear sir
will be able to give him, in relation to his undertaking; And I can
say to you with truth that you could not extend your kindness and
friendship to one more deserving of them than *person_mentioned*Col° Foster*/person_mentioned*. And I
assure you my dear sir that it would be highly gratifying to me
that you would do so.*/p*

*p*I have often thought of paying you a visit and may yet drop
unexpectedly upon you. I should much like to talk over our *location_mentioned*Mexican*/location_mentioned*
connexion, and all the viscissitudes we have since underwent, which
I fondly hope will some time or other take place—perhaps your
business may at no distant day call you into *location_mentioned*this part of the world*/location_mentioned*—
if so depend upon it I will not forego the opportunity of seeing you.
If you have an opportunity and are not too much engaged in forming
your new *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, I would be very glad to receive a letter from
you—in which I would like to find all the little matters relating to
yourself particularly—whether you think of marrying—if you have
any prospect there—or whether you could not make an adventure
among us.    as also the general condition of your *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*and your<barker_pb n="1486"/>
opinion as to its future advancement—Nothing connected with you
and your new *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*would be uninteresting, to me¡ who subscribes
himself,*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*John D. Martin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Colo. S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
