<p>Sir Though I have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance,
yet perhaps my standing and character may not be entirely unknown
to you. I am now in the fifty eighth year of my age, have been a
<person_mentioned>minister of the Presbyterian denomination</person_mentioned> now more than 37 years
and for the last three years have held the <person_mentioned>Presidency of Centre
College at <location_mentioned>Danville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. I give you the information to prepare the
way for some inquiries I wish to make of you respecting the portions
of <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>held by you, and by some other <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>in the region
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. My <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>are nearly grown and, including myself, we
have in the connection five <person_mentioned>ministers </person_mentioned>and I am disposed to make a
<location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>some where that might bring together 40 or 50 or even 100
<person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>and thus spend the evening of life amongst my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in
promoting the cause of literature and religion; and leave them with
prospects of doing good in the <location_mentioned>world</location_mentioned>. I have thought of your
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>but am not in possession of sufficient information to enable
me to make a fair conclusion and have therefore taken the liberty
of troubling you with the following enquiries. 1st Is your title
free from dispute. Also the other 2 or 3 <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>American </person_mentioned>claims</location_mentioned> in your
