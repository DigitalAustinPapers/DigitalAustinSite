*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p*[Matamoros] *date_mentioned n="07-02-1832">July 2 1832*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Sir,*/p*

*p*Since writing things have changed—<hi rend="italic">Exert </hi>by which I wrote to
*person_mentioned*Ugartechea */person_mentioned*and to *person_mentioned*Musquis*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*, the *person_mentioned*alcalde */person_mentioned*and you went *location_mentioned*ashore*/location_mentioned*
*date_mentioned n="07-01-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*and it is said will be lost—this will detain my letters. I
send by *person_mentioned*Grey */person_mentioned*a duplicate to *person_mentioned*Ugartechea*/person_mentioned*—keep a copy of it and my
other letter to him of this date. I have sent a copy to *person_mentioned*Musquis */person_mentioned*of
the letter of *date_mentioned n="06-29-1832">29*/date_mentioned* and I wish you to send him a copy of my other of
this date—also shew them to *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*, but do not have them made 
public—tho use them as the public good may require.*/p*

*p*1.  Let the basis of all that is done be to sustain the constitution
and authority of the *location_mentioned*State of Coahuila y Texas*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*2.  To adhere firmly to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and the *location_mentioned*Mexican confederation*/location_mentioned*, and
to preserve entire the integrity of the *location_mentioned*Mexican Territory*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*3.  To approve of the principles of the *person_mentioned*democratic constitutional
federal party*/person_mentioned*, of which *person_mentioned*Genl. Santana*/person_mentioned* is the active *person_mentioned*leader*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The two first are the most important and must be the basis of all
that is said or done.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Moctesuma */person_mentioned*left *location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*on the *date_mentioned n="06-23-1832">23 */date_mentioned*for *location_mentioned*Victoria */location_mentioned*with 1500 *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*.
*person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*was in that place on the *date_mentioned n="06-27-1832">27*/date_mentioned*, so he cannot come here. *person_mentioned*Mexia*/person_mentioned*
has done himself great credit as a *person_mentioned*man */person_mentioned*and a *person_mentioned*soldier*/person_mentioned*-—all is peace
and harmony. The Grampus U. S. Schooner is here—the *person_mentioned*Cap. 
Tatnall*/person_mentioned* and the *person_mentioned*consul of *location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*Robertson*/person_mentioned* are now in this place.
I think one result of the *person_mentioned*commissioners */person_mentioned*appointed by *person_mentioned*Santana */person_mentioned*and
the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, will be a treaty of peace. Get *person_mentioned*Greaves */person_mentioned*to translate my
letters to *person_mentioned*Ugartechea*/person_mentioned*, so that *person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamto */person_mentioned*can 
understand them, or get *person_mentioned*Chambers */person_mentioned*to do it—let him see them.*/p*

*p*It would be best to leave out the 3d point I mention on the other
side, unless the state of things requires it and *person_mentioned*Ugartechea */person_mentioned*takes that
side—should the *person_mentioned*chief */person_mentioned*be there try and animate him to sustain the
dignity of the *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*against military attacks—have all things suspended 
and try and keep the public mind quiet. I think I shall
go to see *person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*again and from there to *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*—my object is to get
such orders as will put all matters in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*at rest and if the *person_mentioned*Chief*/person_mentioned*
will prepare the mind of the *person_mentioned*Governor */person_mentioned*properly by a statement of
the facts, so as to show that the people have in fact done no more<barker_pb n="811"/>
than to sustain the outraged dignity and authority of the *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*, I
shall be able to do something. But if he throws all the blame on the
*person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*it will be a very bad business all round.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin  */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*
*p*Seal *person_mentioned*Ugartechea*/person_mentioned*'s letter after you have taken the copies and send
it as quick as possible.*/p*
