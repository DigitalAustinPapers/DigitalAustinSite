<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>permit me to introduce to you <person_mentioned>Mr. James Bowie</person_mentioned> a <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>who
stands highly esteemed by his <person_mentioned>acquaintances </person_mentioned>and merits the attention
particularly of the <person_mentioned>citizens of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>as he is disposed to become a
<person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and will evidently be able to promote its
general interest. I hope you and <person_mentioned>Mr. Bowie</person_mentioned> may concur in 
sentiments and that you may facilitate his views.   We are happy to<barker_pb n="331"/>
boast of a most happy change of things since the arrival of <person_mentioned>Dn J. ?.
Padilla</person_mentioned>. I think your hopes will be realized by the course adopted
by the <person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>and we will be able to glide calmly along 
without any remains of former curses. The <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>appear to have their
duty much better than formerly. If they are doing anything in
the old dishonesty it is in a private way and their impertinences
have abated. in much haste</p>
