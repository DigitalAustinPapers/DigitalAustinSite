*p*Dr Sir The *person_mentioned*indians */person_mentioned*have been commiting such outrages on the
*person_mentioned*people of this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, by killing a few hogs and stealing one horse;
and robed the *location_mentioned*camp */location_mentioned*of some *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*who were sawing some plank *location_mentioned*3
miles above this place on the Guadalupe River*/location_mentioned*—the hogs were stolen
below—*location_mentioned*on the River*/location_mentioned*, by the *person_mentioned*Tankawas*/person_mentioned*—, horse was stolen by the
*person_mentioned*cados */person_mentioned*and taken from them again on the waters of the *person_mentioned*St Marcus*/person_mentioned* by
a party of 19 *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*which I sent after them, the *location_mentioned*Camp */location_mentioned*above 
mentioned was robed by the *person_mentioned*Tawaccanies*/person_mentioned*—of about $100 worth of
Tools— I sent a *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*of men out to find their course—after a
march of 4 days on foot—they returned and reported that there were
four in number—when they commited the theft, but were joined by
about 25 more at the *location_mentioned*Cappoto*/location_mentioned*—and bent their course for *location_mentioned*LaBahia*/location_mentioned*,
and crossed the *location_mentioned*San Antonio road 24 miles west of this place*/location_mentioned*—I
raised a party of 17 *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*besides myself and followed them within
*location_mentioned*about 15 miles of LaBahia */location_mentioned*finding on their trail parts of saws which
they had broken which convinced us they were the same *person_mentioned*indians*/person_mentioned*
there they had fallen in with a bout 40 more who had been encamped
there during the last Storm, on that evening we struck their trail
on their way from *location_mentioned*LaBahia */location_mentioned*with a Caviard of a bout 50 horses.—I
put three *person_mentioned*spies */person_mentioned*ahead with orders to report should they see any
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*in a bout one hour, one of the *person_mentioned*spies */person_mentioned*discovered an *person_mentioned*Indian*/person_mentioned*—
riding down from a *location_mentioned*prairie hill*/location_mentioned*; when he broke in to full speed 
without reporting what he had seen—he was too far ahead to hear me
when I ordered him to keep order—consequently he went on and
those who had good horses went on—others whose horses were tired
were *location_mentioned*a mile behind*/location_mentioned*—when I arrived there were five *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*on the
ground—and them scatered for the distance of two hundred yards—
I ordered them to form *location_mentioned*in a small bunch of muskeet trees*/location_mentioned* in about
100 yards of the *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*horses—4 *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*besides myself formed there—
when *person_mentioned*Capt McCoy*/person_mentioned* who was *location_mentioned*in the rear of me*/location_mentioned* order a retreat to
better ground, and reported that the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were a bout to cut off<barker_pb n="176"/>
our *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*who were on tired horses and intirely behind us—this put
the *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*in confusion, and the *person_mentioned*indians */person_mentioned*having made a bold charge
upon us with a hot fire—in order to cover their own *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*who were
then securing their horses—*person_mentioned*John and Andrew Tumlinson*/person_mentioned* who had
tied their horses in the edge of the same thicket where the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*
were, got almost surrounded one of their horses being slightly hit
by a ball, broke a way and joined our horses the other horse being
tied with two hard knots, was siezed by an *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*in a few Steps of
*person_mentioned*John T,*/person_mentioned* whose gun would not fire—the *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*untied the ho[r]se
which got frightened at him; broke loose and Joined our *person_mentioned*company*/person_mentioned*
the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*followed those *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*a few yards and stopt, two of whom
were shot down by our *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*They then retreated in to their thicket,
carrying off their *person_mentioned*dead*/person_mentioned*—we were not able to charge in to their hold
without great loss, as they were too superior in number—therefore
we took our stand in the *location_mentioned*fork of a small creek */location_mentioned*in their view in order
to draw them out—where we could be Sheltered by a few muskeet
trees; where we remained for some time, but without any attack—
we then with drew Slowly for a few hundred yards when we 
discovered them in full chase on horse back—we then took our stand
and drove them with the loss of two more of their number; it then
being after dark we Struck our course for *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*; as I did not wish
to hazard the lives of any the *person_mentioned*Citizen */person_mentioned*on such unequal grounds; for
we were compelled to fight them at a place of [their] own selection;
and which was almost impenetreble.*/p*

*p*I have given you this detail of the affair precisely as it was
tra[n]sacted, in order to show you we were not the *person_mentioned*agressers*/person_mentioned*, but
were persuing our property and were fired upon first by themselves.
Your Old friend *person_mentioned*Don G. Flores*/person_mentioned* was robed of his horses*location_mentioned* between
this and San Antonio */location_mentioned*and went home on foot as I am informed—.
I have received information from *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*—that the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*have
stolen a great many horses from that place and that there are 200
*person_mentioned*Soldiers */person_mentioned*now in persuit of them. The fact is I believe the *person_mentioned*Caddos*/person_mentioned*
*person_mentioned*Wacos */person_mentioned**person_mentioned*Comanches */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Tawaccanies */person_mentioned*are all concerned in the affair;
and unless there is some precaution taken they will harrass the
*person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*on the *location_mentioned*frontiers */location_mentioned*of both of these *location_mentioned*Colonies*/location_mentioned*; and the only means
will be to keep *person_mentioned*troops */person_mentioned*of some discription on the alert from the
*location_mentioned*Colorado */location_mentioned*to the *location_mentioned*Guadalupe*/location_mentioned*, and thence to *location_mentioned*San Antonia*/location_mentioned* which would
be the means of giving information of their approach and put people
on their guard so that they could protect them selves and property.
I would wish you to take these things in to consideration; and should
you approve of the measure—use your influence to affect it, either
by a*person_mentioned* Company of Rangers,*/person_mentioned* or the *person_mentioned*public troops*/person_mentioned* which would be a
great security to the *person_mentioned*people of *location_mentioned*San Antonia*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*LaBahia */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*as well
as to *location_mentioned*American Settlements*/location_mentioned**/p*.<barker_pb n="177"/>

*p*I have addressed a short note to the *person_mentioned*Alcalde at *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* on
the subject of the expected election at this place which is very much
wished for and needed as well for the Organization of the *person_mentioned*Militia*/person_mentioned*
as that of a *person_mentioned*civil officer*/person_mentioned* in this place which I hope you will urge as
soon as possible, as our Safety greatly depends on a well Organized
*person_mentioned*Militia*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

measures in case the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*should prove hostile.*/p*
