*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*Esteemed Sir At the solicitation of the *person_mentioned*friends of Mr Gillespie*/person_mentioned*
I write to enquire after the circumstances of his death. *person_mentioned*Mrs. Gillespie*/person_mentioned* says *person_mentioned*Mr Gillespie*/person_mentioned* left *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*with five hundred dollars and
had made arrangements, whereby he was to receive as much more
in *location_mentioned*Natches*/location_mentioned* making the sum of one thousand dollars Some of his
*person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned* are of opinion that he received several hundred dollars on
the way that his *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned* knew nothing of. it appears however very
certain that he aught to have had $1000. His fellow *person_mentioned*Traveller */person_mentioned*and
*person_mentioned*confident */person_mentioned*(*person_mentioned*Capt. Lusk*/person_mentioned*) writes from *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned* in a very short
and unexplanatory manner informing *person_mentioned*Mrs. Gillespie*/person_mentioned* of her *person_mentioned*Husband*/person_mentioned*s death stating he had died after some ten or fifteen days
Illness at the *location_mentioned*Fort in your Colony*/location_mentioned* (I suppose the *location_mentioned*Fort Settlement*/location_mentioned*)
that he *person_mentioned*Capt Lusk*/person_mentioned* had sold *person_mentioned*Mr. Gillespie*/person_mentioned*'s horse to pay his Burial
expenses that himself was then in *location_mentioned*New Orlean*/location_mentioned* on his way to the
State of *location_mentioned*Ohio*/location_mentioned*. There is nothing in *person_mentioned*Capt Lusk*/person_mentioned*s letter to give us
to understand what disposition was made of the money he (*person_mentioned*Mr
Gillespie*/person_mentioned*) had. There appears to be a mistery in the affair which
makes it due to the *person_mentioned*family of Mr Gillespie*/person_mentioned* and the character of
*person_mentioned*Capt. Lusk*/person_mentioned* that an enquiry should be made as such you would
confer a favour on us by making such enquiries as would account
for the disposition of the money he had with him whether disposed of in the purchase of Land or otherwise and give us as early
information as may comport with your convenience.*/p*

little to say here You will write me on every subject which might
be of any importance as it is seldom we receive the Truth from
*location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. I expect young *person_mentioned*Mr Hughs*/person_mentioned* will have arrived before you
receive this as he left here some time ago.*/p*

*p*I have been told of a Proclamation of *person_mentioned*Mr Edwards*/person_mentioned* requiring the
