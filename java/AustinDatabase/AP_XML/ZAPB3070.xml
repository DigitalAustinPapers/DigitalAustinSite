<p><location_mentioned>Jessamine County Ky</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="02-09-1826">9th Feb 1826</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. James E. B. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir I have not had the pleasure of a communication from
you for about 2 years, nor have I written you during that time, but
from no other cause but the impossibility of a safe conveyance—I
have now an opportunity by <person_mentioned>Dr J. Fry</person_mentioned> which I gladly embrace—</p>

<p>In your last you recommended me to come to your <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned> which at
that time I had an idea of doing, but afterwards got into business
here that was tolerably good and for that reason, then declined it.
I have not yet however, changed my determination, should the inducement be sufficient, for I am yet unmarried and ready to start to
any <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned> that holds out a sufficient inducement, and shall wait
with anxiety to hear from you on the subject—</p>

<p>A great many persons are now talking of removing to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned> and
believe the number will increase, <person_mentioned>John M. Henderson</person_mentioned> lately started
to <location_mentioned>New. Orleans</location_mentioned>, and it is his intention to go from there to your
<location_mentioned>Brother's settlement</location_mentioned>, you know <person_mentioned>John</person_mentioned>, and it is needless for me to
say he is deserving of your friendship, and his knowledge of the <barker_pb n="1263"/>
duties of a <person_mentioned>Clerk </person_mentioned>might possibly be of service to your <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned> or at
least to assure himself the means of a livelihood—</p>

<p>Times and <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>have changed in this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned> more than you
would imagine,—I know not how long it has been since you have heard
from here, but presume it has been some time, under this presumption
I now write, and shall give a summary detail of your old <person_mentioned>acquaintances</person_mentioned>, but if my presumption is erroneous, and you have lately heard
from some of your <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>here then the letter or that part of it that
looks anterior to your previous information will be useless—I will
however proceed,—<person_mentioned>Wm Walker</person_mentioned> is living <location_mentioned>in the lower part of this
State</location_mentioned> he is keeping a <location_mentioned>Tavern </location_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>road between this and Nashville</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Georgian</person_mentioned> is yet unmarried, I have not seen any of the <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>
for 3 years but am told she is handsome beyond comparison, <person_mentioned>Martha</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Jane</person_mentioned> you have no doubt heard are both married, <person_mentioned>John C. Walker</person_mentioned>
is living somewhere in <location_mentioned>Tennessee</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>George</person_mentioned> was some time since in
<location_mentioned>Warrington Missippi</location_mentioned>, I know not where <person_mentioned>Andrew</person_mentioned> is, <person_mentioned>Kidder</person_mentioned> is
teaching <location_mentioned>school </location_mentioned>I am informed near <location_mentioned>Russellville</location_mentioned> in this <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>. I
have not seen him for near 2 years. <person_mentioned>Jacob</person_mentioned> was, not long since at
<location_mentioned>Mobile, Alabama</location_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Joseph</person_mentioned> is living with <person_mentioned>Dr E. Warfield</person_mentioned> in his
<location_mentioned>Store </location_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned>—so much for the <person_mentioned>Walker family</person_mentioned> for which I
presume you feel a deeper interest, than for any other in this <location_mentioned>County</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Major R. Crockett</person_mentioned> is living in <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned> and some time since talked
of going to your <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, but believe he has not yet gone—It would
be almost an endless task for me to pretend to give you a detail of
the miner events that have transpired since you left us, such as
marriages deaths &c suffice it that I am almost the only man you
knew in the <person_mentioned>county</person_mentioned> but what has either married or gone off—<person_mentioned>Dr, J.
Fry</person_mentioned> called upon me this morning for the letter to you which, with
much pleasure I gave him, believing him to be entirely a gentleman
and worthy of your confidence—</p>

<p>In that letter I added a Postscript, stating, that if a great press of
business did not prevent, I would write you by him, which he politely
promised to be the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned>of—he also, promised to bear a communication from you on his return which I hope you will send, as it would
give me the greatest pleasure to hear from you,—</p>

<p>Wishing you health prosperity and happiness</p>
