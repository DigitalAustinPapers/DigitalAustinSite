*p*Dear Sir—I sent your letter to *person_mentioned*Smith and Stillman*/person_mentioned* from *location_mentioned*Canada*/location_mentioned*,
and by this last mail reed, their answer, and an order on the *person_mentioned*agent*/person_mentioned*
of the late firm of*person_mentioned* R. P. Staples and Co*/person_mentioned*. for the acknowledged balance
of $756.05. The *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*left here for *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*before I reed, their
orders. I applied to some others who are employed in arranging
the accounts of the concern, and they all tell me that nothing can
be had, and recommended that the account be sent to some one in
*location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*to represent it at the <hi rend="italic">concurso </hi>of the *person_mentioned*creditors*/person_mentioned*.   I fear this<barker_pb n="770"/>
money will be lost—so far as I understand, the affairs of the *location_mentioned*house*/location_mentioned*
are much more embarrased than was supposed. *person_mentioned*Mr Sharpe one
of the agents of the concern */person_mentioned*here, for posting up the books (a
*person_mentioned*Philadelphian*/person_mentioned*) thinks that not over 20 pr. cent, will be divided-
he says that your debt was lost by neglect for if it had been called
for *date_mentioned n="12-xx-1831">six months ago*/date_mentioned* it would have been paid, as the *person_mentioned*creditors */person_mentioned*in
*location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*had then agreed to suffer the house to go on—since then
they have become alarmed, and every one is pressing—the result
is a total stopage. I have written to *person_mentioned*Smith and Stillman*/person_mentioned* on the
subject and recommend them to send the account to *person_mentioned*Parrot*/person_mentioned*, to do
the best he can with it. I leave *date_mentioned n="05-09-1832">to-morrow*/date_mentioned* for *location_mentioned*victoria */location_mentioned*and shall not
return to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*before *date_mentioned n="10-xx-1832">October*/date_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Mason */person_mentioned*goes with me to see the
*person_mentioned*General */person_mentioned*on business, and he has a fair prospect of effecting 
something tho to what extent is rather doubtful. The political state of
things is still unsettled and it is doubtful what will be the result,
and whether the *person_mentioned*ministers */person_mentioned*will be able to sustain themselves or not.
It matters not much for *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, provided peace and harmony can
be preserved there which is all important now. I have very friendly
letters from *person_mentioned*Don Lucas Alaman,*/person_mentioned* *person_mentioned*Genl. Teran */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*Vice 
President*/person_mentioned*. The memorial of the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento of *location_mentioned*Austin */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*has been
passed to *person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*with the recommendation of the *person_mentioned*President*/person_mentioned*, and
the prospect is good of a repeal of the 11 article of the law of *date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">6 April
1830*/date_mentioned* also of a modification of the duties. Remember me to *person_mentioned*Mrs A.
*/person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*.           Yours truly  */p*

*p*You ought to loose no time in locating your other *location_mentioned*sitio*/location_mentioned*—*/p*
