*p**date_mentioned n="07-30-1826">30th July 1826*/date_mentioned* —*/p*
*p*Dear Sir, I came here this *date_mentioned n="07-30-1826">morning*/date_mentioned*—your *person_mentioned*brother */person_mentioned*has just left—
I shall over take him *date_mentioned n="07-31-1826">tomorrow*/date_mentioned*.   *person_mentioned*Dewitt */person_mentioned*is in the *location_mentioned*bay or bacca*/location_mentioned*—<barker_pb n="1391"/>
Several of the people *person_mentioned*resident */person_mentioned*of the *location_mentioned*fort */location_mentioned*are now here— I have
endeavored to ascertain, there intentions—They will no doubt leave
the place before the *date_mentioned n="08-31-1826">last of next month*/date_mentioned*—They will I believe all or
nearly so go below—In that case this will be an out side, and I even
doubt whether this place will be occupied long after the *location_mentioned*fort */location_mentioned*breaks—.*/p*

*p*I am somewhat of the opinion that were you to write to *person_mentioned*Capt.
Burnham*/person_mentioned* and invite him to see you; and you would give him some
indulgence in the price and payment of his land that probiblely he
would stop here, and station,—should he do so it will Induce others
to stop also.*/p*

*p*This however is conjecture on my part.—tho I think it merits some
consideration.*/p*

*p*Those people have now growing crops that they flattered 
themselves would turn in to there acts, sufficient funds to pay the balanse
due to you—and under the present circumstances it is not likely
that they will realize one Dollar—by them. They are poor and
have *person_mentioned*familys */person_mentioned*and the loss of a crop is to them a serious thing.*/p*

*p*As I have mearly sugested the subject to you for your 
consideration ; I hope you will excuse the freedom I have taken*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*James Kerr*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*P. S. I would not be understood, as giving to *person_mentioned*Capt Burnham*/person_mentioned* 
Indulgences that could not be extended to all eaqual meritorious—but
to consult with him as a kind of *person_mentioned*forman*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Woods*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Since I sealed this I have recd a mesage from *person_mentioned*Colo Dewitt*/person_mentioned*—He is
off the *location_mentioned*mouth of the vacca*/location_mentioned*—and is afraid to land on account of the
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*that are in the *location_mentioned*neighbourhood*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I have therefore to repair to his Assistance Immediately*/p*
