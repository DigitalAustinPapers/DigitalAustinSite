*p**person_mentioned*Col. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*                                                         

*p*Sir I recd- your communication to *person_mentioned*Wm Kincheloe*/person_mentioned* to send you
the plat of the*location_mentioned* Leagues on the Colorado*/location_mentioned* from *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Kuykendall*/person_mentioned*'s League*/location_mentioned*
down. I have sent them over, and accompanying them you will find
the field notes of several Leagues in the *location_mentioned*Bay Prairie*/location_mentioned* and one on the
*location_mentioned*Bernard*/location_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Mr Selkirk*/person_mentioned* has run off the Leagues on the *location_mentioned*West side of the
Colorado*/location_mentioned*, and from actual survey some of the lines differ 
considerable from the plat, and those numbers that differ you will find
either over or under the others and a bar across them thus,
in this way I have corrected all the lines, on the *location_mentioned*west side of the river
*/location_mentioned*Those Leagues where *person_mentioned*Selkirk*/person_mentioned* run on *location_mentioned*both sides of the river*/location_mentioned* closed
very well, and very little alteration had to be made. Be careful and
reccollect that those numbers that have the bar accross them are the
right ones—We have run the Leagues as far down as *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Duke*/person_mentioned*s place
*/location_mentioned*and have not yet touched the *location_mentioned*Lake*/location_mentioned* that *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned* lines on. I call it
a Lake because, since I left town I have been down to *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned* and
find that the *location_mentioned*south end of it is about two miles from *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned*. We
go into the *location_mentioned*woods */location_mentioned*again tomorrow and shall succeed in finishing I
think by the middle of *date_mentioned n="02-xx-1825">Feb*/date_mentioned*. if nothing uncommon takes place—*/p*

*p*I understand that *person_mentioned*Mr Buckner*/person_mentioned* has been to *location_mentioned*Town*/location_mentioned* and made ap-
plication for the League taking in *location_mentioned*the forks of Hunney  and Caney<barker_pb n="1020"/>
creeks*/location_mentioned*, that is a choice that I made more than *date_mentioned n="12-xx-1824">one month ago*/date_mentioned*, running 
it so as to take in the forks and the head of tide if it would do
both, I have not yet got any land on tide water and do not think that
*person_mentioned*Mr. Buckner*/person_mentioned* has done quite right in taking that advantage of me,
however, I shall leave it to you to make it right.-*/p*

*p*I have heard of *person_mentioned*Mr. Tong*/person_mentioned* at *person_mentioned*Esqr Bells*/person_mentioned* but have not yet seen him.*/p*

*p*I have no more at present, but remain with due respect your friend
and humble*/p*
