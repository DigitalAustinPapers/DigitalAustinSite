intention when it was issued and it is my impression yet that you
ought then to go no farther than execute to the ten days was expired
that was allowed him to find security for an appeal.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Strange</person_mentioned> has stated to me that you wished to know if you
ought to have the property valued. I have now [no] law 
respecting it I give it as my opinion that it ought if you sell at 
<location_mentioned>harrisburgh </location_mentioned>and the property <location_mentioned>on board of the vessel</location_mentioned> I think the property
ought to be present at the sale if it could be got there it does not
look right to me to have them a part when it is possible to have
the property present I hope you will not allow or give reason for
a slur to be cast on the district it is the first execution that has
been Tride before me, I would have been more free to your <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>

right at my self to do any business at that time I am with 
Respect Yours</p>

many of people com- ?]ing and I knew if I sold on board [there
would be very few  ?] <person_mentioned>biders </person_mentioned>to bring it here would so of caused
