*p*Dear Sir,*/p*

*p*You were advised some few weeks ago of the safe arrival of your
Box of Books—I have now an opportunity of sending them by the
*person_mentioned*bearer*/person_mentioned*, which I embrace, and hope they will reach you in safety*/p*

*p*I have not very lately heard from *person_mentioned*Mrs Hawkins*/person_mentioned*, but believe
herself and *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*are well—She still lives with her younger *person_mentioned*sister*/person_mentioned*
the only one of that *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*that is independent and able to give
her a support—I hope the time is not far distant when such charity
will be unnecessary—From the great numbers of persons passing
through to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*I feel assured your *location_mentioned*Province */location_mentioned*will soon fill up and
Enable you to make sale of lands.*/p*

*p*What is *person_mentioned*Mr Gross*/person_mentioned* doing with his cotton—The price is now an
object—35 Cts. I should suppose it would be well worth getting
ginned and shipped immediately.*/p*
