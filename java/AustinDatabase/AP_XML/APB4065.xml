*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Coln Piedras*/person_mentioned* it appears has of late received orders, not to suffer
any persons to pass here, unless they have actually made a Contract,
either with yourself or *person_mentioned*Dewitt*/person_mentioned*; or have a passport, from the *person_mentioned*Mexican
Consul*/person_mentioned*—in case of a previous Contract being made he requires 
Documents to that effect-— <hi rend="italic">He has a strong disposition to strictly
adhere to his order</hi>*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*bearer */person_mentioned*brot with him such voucher as the Colonization Law
required—and presented himself to the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*but it appears the
*person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*have not the power of judging of the qualifications
requisite, as the *person_mentioned*Coln */person_mentioned*took them from the *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Alcaldie*/person_mentioned*s office*/location_mentioned*, and acted
on them himself— you will readily see the embarresments, it will
place those Innocent *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*under, that Emigrate to the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*
in good faith; and rarely with much surplus Means— It must have
the effect to retard Emigration and as a good wisher of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*,
I have always used my feeble exertions to encourage its settlement*/p*

*p*You are I presume acquainted with the late regulations on the
subject of *p*Teran*/p*s reserves etc—or I would say more— If you
have any *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*Emigrating on the Road, that will pass thro this
*location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*, would it not be well to give *person_mentioned*Coln Piedras*/person_mentioned* a List of the Names,
which would supersede the necessity of there riding to *location_mentioned*Sn Phillepe*/location_mentioned*,
and perhaps much difficulty.<barker_pb n="525"/>*/p*

*p*I am induced to write to you, as I am told many *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*are
expected—and the advance season will not admit of there delaying
much time on the Road—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Coln S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*         *person_mentioned* F. Thorn*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*P. S. I start for *location_mentioned*N. Orleans*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="10-30-1830">Tomorrow*/date_mentioned*, and expect to be absent 2 Months*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*F. T*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*as I deem it expedient that you should receive this as soon as
possible, I send it on by mail, under the direction of *person_mentioned*Colo Ruis*/person_mentioned*, for
it is out of my power to see you myself for a few days*/p*
