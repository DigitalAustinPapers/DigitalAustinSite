*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="06-15-1826">15th June 1826*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*My Dear *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned*,
*/p*
*p*I have not written you since my return from the *location_mentioned*Interior */location_mentioned*owing
to a suitable conveyance not having presented itself And my being
compelled to go out on an *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*excursion shortly after my arrival—
We returned without being able to effect any thing owing to the 
inclemancy of the season and the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*having left their *location_mentioned*Villages*/location_mentioned*'—
We apprehend no danger fron the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*their numbers are too
small to harass us in any other way than by Stealing a few horses—
which they do occasionally— During my abscence my *person_mentioned*brother */person_mentioned*
received a letter from you dated in*date_mentioned n="01-xx-1826"> January last*/date_mentioned* containing the 
unpleasant intelligence of the loss of many of our *person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*—within the
last year, a loss more afflicting to us owing to the few that are left
of what was but a few years since a numerous and happy Circle—¦
I fear that by the time my *person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*and myself can return to 
*location_mentioned*Missouri */location_mentioned*we shall find but few of our old *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*alive—*/p*

*p*Our *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*is improving daily the emigration that has taken
place lately has been principally by water— Vessels arrive—or
touch*location_mentioned* at the mouth of this river */location_mentioned*frequently and two will ply
regularly between this and *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned*; I entertain but little
doubt that a passage could be procured at almost any time; Should
*person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* wish to come out to visit the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*either this *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1826">fall */date_mentioned*or
*date_mentioned n="Spring- 1827">next spring*/date_mentioned* I would advise him to come by water— The last
Vessel was only 5—-days from the *location_mentioned*City */location_mentioned*and three—from the *location_mentioned*Balize*/location_mentioned*
to the *location_mentioned*mouth of the river*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Our crops are very promising this Season— Considerable 
cotton will be made—which will be inferior to none made in any part
of the *location_mentioned*US*/location_mentioned*— All that is wanting to make this the most desirable
part of the habitable *location_mentioned*Globe */location_mentioned*is a Sufficient population—which it
must have in a few years—*/p*

*p*I am happy to hear that the *person_mentioned*boys */person_mentioned*improve, I hope you will not
neglect placing them as soon as they are old enough in a Situation
whereby they may acquire a thorough knowledge of business*/p*

*p*Have you done any thing in the *location_mentioned*Durham Hall*/location_mentioned*—business yet—?
what does *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* think of the probability of recovering it— If
any thing is done I think it ought to be done immediately*/p*—

*p*I have nothing more to communicate at present *person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*is well—
I wish you to send out the work of *person_mentioned*Schoolcrafts */person_mentioned*it would be 
gratifying to us to see it— Give my respects to all my old *person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*-
Kiss little *person_mentioned*Mary*/person_mentioned*— and tell *person_mentioned*Jack */person_mentioned*his *person_mentioned*uncle */person_mentioned*will expect a letter from
him shortly—    Before I close I must inform you of the death of<barker_pb n="1359"/>
*person_mentioned*Thomas Alley*/person_mentioned*  he was unfortunately drowned -crossing the *location_mentioned*Brazos*/location_mentioned*
on our last Campaign against the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*Old *person_mentioned*Mr- Andrews*/person_mentioned* was well the last time I heard from him—*/p*

*p*I leave this on the 06-16-1826
for my place down the *location_mentioned*Brazos*/location_mentioned*— probably
 I shall not have an opportunity of writing you for Some
time— The *person_mentioned*Murderer */person_mentioned*of *person_mentioned*William Perry*/person_mentioned* has not reached this part
of the *location_mentioned*Province */location_mentioned*yet— the last information I received he was on
<hi rend="italic">Red River</hi> in *location_mentioned*Arkensas Terry*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Jas B. Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mrs- Emily M Perry*/person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

he was *date_mentioned n="01-xx-1826">six months ago*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*JB A*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*your letter was truly welcome for I have not heard from you for
many months— you say nothing about moving— neither can I
give you any other advice on the subject, than what I have 
heretofore said which is, that I wish *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* to come and look for 
himself before he determines— I am Satisfied to spend my life here,
but I should be much more so if you were with us— Our crops this
year are much more abundant than they have been since the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*
commenced— the Season has been very favourable, if any thing
rather too wet, particularly the beginning of this month— 
remember me to all friends and particularly *person_mentioned*Mrs. John Perry*/person_mentioned* and all the
*person_mentioned*Perry family*/person_mentioned* etc. write often and give all the *location_mentioned*Potosi */location_mentioned*news in 
detail— we Still live in *location_mentioned*log cabins*/location_mentioned*— rather poor, tho plenty of
corn Beef and Bacon— Kiss the *person_mentioned*Children */person_mentioned*for their *person_mentioned*uncle*/person_mentioned**/p*
