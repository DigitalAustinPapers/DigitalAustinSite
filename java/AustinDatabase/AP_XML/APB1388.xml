*p*My Dr *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*A considerable period has elapsed since I had the pleasure of
receiving a letter from my dear *person_mentioned*Emily*/person_mentioned*—Can an absence of only a
few years, entirely have obliterated from her memory a *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*
she onced loved! What can be the cause of her long silence ? 
perhaps she is so much engaged in her <hi rend="italic">domestic </hi>duties that she cannot
"<hi rend="italic">steal</hi>" time to devote a few <hi rend="italic">leisure </hi>moments to her <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Brown*/person_mentioned*</hi>, 
Excuse me *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">for </hi>reproaching you for your negligence for I <hi rend="italic">assure</hi>
you I have been much <hi rend="italic">hurt </hi>at your long silence. You perhaps think
I am hardly justifiable, in blaming you for a fault you think I
am equally <hi rend="italic">censurable </hi>for but on this point I can satisfy you—For
the last year I have been absent from the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*—and in a *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
where there was no mode of conveying a letter to the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*—Shortly
after my arrival I wrote you from *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*, and since then I
have been anxiously expecting a letter from you—*/p*

*p*You have no doubt heard long since, the happy termination of
the disturbances on this *location_mentioned*frontier */location_mentioned*and the conspicuous part Our
*person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*acted in bringing to a close so unnatural rebellion—At this
time the utmost harmony prevails in every part of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and
<hi rend="italic">so far</hi> we are blessed with a prospect of a plentiful harvest in a
healthy season,*/p*

*p*We are not entirely forgotten by our *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*in the north*/location_mentioned* a few
days since we received a lenthy letter from *person_mentioned*Henry Austin*/person_mentioned* dated
in <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*</hi>—*person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*has answered it and recommen[d]ed him to
come and see the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*and I think he will be out in the fall—
My sole wish is to see our scattered *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*once more United and
I think there is some little prospect of their being so provided
*person_mentioned*Henry */person_mentioned*is pleased with the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I have nothing new to communicate—we have a prospect of a
considerable emigration <hi rend="italic">from *location_mentioned*Ohio*/location_mentioned*</hi> *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1827">next fall*/date_mentioned*—*/p*<barker_pb n="1645"/>

*p*Our State constitution is to be published in this place on the *date_mentioned n="05-29-1827">29th*/date_mentioned*.
inst it is an excellent one—no *person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*are permitted to be 
introduced *date_mentioned n="11-29-1827">6 months after its publication*/date_mentioned*, which will give until the *date_mentioned n="11-29-1827">29th
of next November*/date_mentioned* to introduce them—No person can be born a
*person_mentioned*slave */person_mentioned*in this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*after the publication of the Constitution. If
there are any *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*in your part of the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*having <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Slaves*/person_mentioned*</hi>,
that wish to remove here—<hi rend="italic">hurry </hi>them on before the expiration of
the time—*/p*

*p*I wish you to write me a lengthy letter and give me all the 
*location_mentioned*Neighbourhood */location_mentioned*news Any thing is interesting to me at this immense
distance from you. Tell me something about *person_mentioned*Elias's family.*/person_mentioned* *person_mentioned*Mary*/person_mentioned*
—*person_mentioned*Adaline*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Eliza*/person_mentioned*—and *person_mentioned*Maria*/person_mentioned*—remember me to them affectionately
I <hi rend="italic">never </hi>hear from them—I suppose they have forgotten me too.
*person_mentioned*Moses */person_mentioned*has lost a fortune by not comeing out to this *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*in time—
tho it is not too late—if he comes by *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1827">fall*/date_mentioned*—Remember me 
affectionately to my little <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Nephews */person_mentioned*</hi>and kiss my <hi rend="italic">dear </hi>little " <hi rend="italic">blue eyed *person_mentioned*Mary*/person_mentioned*</hi> "
for me—My respects to *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*brother */person_mentioned*sends his love to you
and will write you by this opportunity—*/p*
