<p><location_mentioned>Mexican Consulate</p>
<p>New Orleans </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="08-11-1831">Augt 11 1831</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Col Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir By an arrival <date_mentioned n="08-10-1831">yesterday </date_mentioned>I am favored with a 
communication from <person_mentioned>Mr George Fisher</person_mentioned> dated <date_mentioned n="07-06-1831">6 July</date_mentioned>, in which he says you
are in want of a Copy of your officio to him of the <date_mentioned n="06-05-1831">5th of June,</date_mentioned> which
he remited to this consulate. I herewith hand you a Copy of <person_mentioned>Mr.
Fisher</person_mentioned>s entire Letter to me, in which yours to him is embodied</p>

<p>In <person_mentioned>Mr. Fisher</person_mentioned>s letter to me of the <date_mentioned n="07-06-1831">6 July</date_mentioned> I am surprised to
find the following sentence "<person_mentioned>Free people of Colour</person_mentioned> are coming in
dayley into this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, and you are much sensured on the subject??</p>

<p>Now I would like to know why sensure should be attached to me
for the commission of acts in which I can have no agency what ever,
on the receit of your officio, I published in the <location_mentioned>dayly Gazett</location_mentioned> of this
<location_mentioned>City </location_mentioned>that all <person_mentioned>free Negroes</person_mentioned> who had been driven out of <location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>by
a law of the <person_mentioned>last Legislature</person_mentioned> were forbid en to enter the <location_mentioned>States of
Cohahuila and Texas</location_mentioned>, and all <person_mentioned>masters </person_mentioned>of Vessels were informed that
they would be compelled to bring away all such <person_mentioned>passengers </person_mentioned>they
might have on board their Vessels, which was doing all I could 
lawfully do to put a stop to such <person_mentioned>Emigrants</person_mentioned>, for I defy any man of that
discription to shew a passport from this consulate Since the date of
my publications.</p>

<p>If the <person_mentioned>authorities of Texas</person_mentioned> who have the power of preventing
those <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>being landed on their <location_mentioned>shores</location_mentioned>, or entering by land, will
not Exercise it, I am not to be blamed.   I have no power here as a<barker_pb n="689"/>
<person_mentioned>Mexican Agent</person_mentioned> to prevent their going on board Vessels leaving this
<location_mentioned>port</location_mentioned>, then why not let the blame rest on the proper persons, Such
things are calculated to injure my Commercial business with <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.
I hope therefore you will do me the Justice to correct the erronious
opinions of its being my fault</p>
