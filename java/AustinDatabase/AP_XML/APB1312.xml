*p**location_mentioned*Sn Carlos*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="10-31-1826">Octr 31st 1826*/date_mentioned*.*/p*
*p*My Dr *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I arrived at this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*on the *date_mentioned n="10-19-1826">19th inst*/date_mentioned*. I found *person_mentioned*Dn Luciano*/person_mentioned* 
absent,—but I immediately proceeded to his <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Rancho de la Luz*/location_mentioned*</hi>. (*location_mentioned*4 Leagues from this*/location_mentioned*) where he was. The <hi rend="italic">old *person_mentioned*Ranchero*/person_mentioned*</hi> was much
surprised, but overjoyed to see me:—After the usual salutations,
inquiries after friends, Acquaintances, etc had passed, I made known
the Object of my visit; he replied, that but one obstacle presented
itself to prevent my taking in 12. <hi rend="italic">Manadas</hi>:, or 300 head, (which
is the numr <hi rend="italic">he himself</hi> proposed)—That obstacle was the excessive
drouth, that prevailed throughout this section of the *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*, and
which, had caused his herds to ramble to a great distance. After
remaining at the *location_mentioned*Rancho */location_mentioned*three days, undetermined what to do, I
found myself compelled to return to this *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*; as the *location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">water pool</hi>at the Rancho*/location_mentioned*, was entirely exausted, and the animals were 
beginning to perish.—In this perplexity, I concluded to remain untill
the arrival of the mail, and then start for the *location_mentioned*Brazos*/location_mentioned*, with a view
of returning in the *date_mentioned n="SPring-1827">Spring*/date_mentioned*, or *date_mentioned n="Summer-1827">summer*/date_mentioned*, as I had become fully convinced that an attempt to have taken in any number of horses at
this time would have been attended with considerable loss—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Dn Luciano*/person_mentioned* informed me that it had not rained here for one
year—While I remained in this state of suspence, the weather 
suddenly changed, and in the short space of <hi rend="italic">three hours</hi> fell the most
tremendous torrent of rain I ever witnessed; The water rushed from
the *location_mentioned*Mountains */location_mentioned*with such impetuosity, that every thing was swept<barker_pb n="1483"/>
in the values beneath; in an instant, all the Empty <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Tanques */location_mentioned*</hi>were
filled, and there is a supply of water for nearly a year to come—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Dn Luciano*/person_mentioned* soon informed me that he intended to collect his
scattered flocks immediately, and I could take the number he had
offered;. I shall wait untill he herds them, and take a part of the
amt he has offered say 150 or 200 head.*/p*

*p*I hope to start from here, by the *date_mentioned n="11-12-1826">12 of Novr*/date_mentioned* and be with you by
the*date_mentioned n="12-15-1826"> 15th*/date_mentioned* or *date_mentioned n="12-20-1826">20th of Decembr*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*The mule project I am compelled to abandon, owing to their
scarcity and dearness, $50 to $70 pr. pair is what is currently given
by the *person_mentioned*Mexicans*/person_mentioned*—I shall not take time to go and see *person_mentioned*Dn Felipe*/person_mentioned*,
altho I am confident I could procure both mules and horses from
him.*/p*

*p*I am tired of this *location_mentioned*Barren Mountainous Country*/location_mentioned*, and wish to get
back once more to *location_mentioned*Sn Felipe */location_mentioned*after seeing as much of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*
as I have I shall know how to justly appreciate the fertility of our
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*soil—*/p*

*p*I wish you to have the *location_mentioned*lot */location_mentioned*refenced very strong or one of the
*location_mentioned*back lots*/location_mentioned* it will be necessary to keep the Manadas at *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*, untill we determine where to put them, and prepare *location_mentioned*pens */location_mentioned*for their 
reception etc; I shall take in a sufficient number of *person_mentioned*Vaceros */person_mentioned*to attend to
them: and I flatter myself that in a short time we shall have a snug
little <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Rancho*/location_mentioned*</hi>—then you or myself (or *person_mentioned*both of us*/person_mentioned*) must get a <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*wife*/person_mentioned*</hi>
and forget the cares and perplexities of the world, in the pleasures
to be found in a <hi rend="italic">Pastoral life.</hi> During my short stay among these
*location_mentioned*mountains*/location_mentioned*, I have ceased to wonder why so many *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*labour
under (what is called) the <hi rend="italic">Blue Devils</hi>, Horrors Hippo, or 
whatever else you may please to call those fits of Apathy we find attending
most persons at certain times, in a greater or less degree—and which
is a complaint you are not altogether clear of—but I sincerely hope
that since I have left *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*you have not been visited by a single
symtom; for <hi rend="italic">God </hi>knows I have been tormented enough for us
both.*/p*

*p*I have lived the Solitary, ever since I have been here. *person_mentioned*Dn Luciano
*/person_mentioned*is a perfect hermit—since his return from *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*he has resided at
his <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Rancho de la Luz*/location_mentioned*</hi>: rarely has communication with any one,
except his *person_mentioned*Vaceros */person_mentioned*Comes to <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Town */location_mentioned*to Hug</hi> his *person_mentioned*Frigoña*/person_mentioned*, once a month.
Spends good part of his time Sleeping and eating.*/p*

*p*he says he has procured his discharge from the *person_mentioned*Army */person_mentioned*and 
henceforward he intends to live (<hi rend="italic">Una </hi>Vida sosegada) I tell him we wish
to live a <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Ranchero's */person_mentioned*life</hi> but attended with a <hi rend="italic">little </hi>more variety.*/p*

*p*I wrote you from *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*on every point of importance. I hope
ere this the *person_mentioned*slave */person_mentioned*question is decided; the *person_mentioned*Baron */person_mentioned*promised to write
to you immediately after the question was decided.*/p*<barker_pb n="1484"/>

*p*You have many warm *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*—Among them you may
Count on *person_mentioned*Dn Ygnacio Arizpe the Govr of the State*/person_mentioned*, also *person_mentioned*Gonzales*/person_mentioned*,
it will be fortunate for the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*If he can be reelected and what
little <hi rend="italic">aid </hi>the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*can render him should be done with pleasure-
As he entertains the sincerest friendship towards <hi rend="italic">your *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*</hi>in
particular; also any thing that you wish to communicate to *person_mentioned*Govr */person_mentioned*you
can do it with Confidence through *person_mentioned*Padilla */person_mentioned*you have not a warmer
*person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*in the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*than he I have nothing more to say at 
present—I will try and eat my <hi rend="italic">Christmas dinner</hi> with you—should you
happen to <hi rend="italic">visit </hi>up <hi rend="italic">the river</hi> present <hi rend="italic">my respects to the *person_mentioned*female part of the family*/person_mentioned*</hi>*/p*

*p*Remember me to *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned*—and *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*—I hope the *location_mentioned*Gin */location_mentioned*is in 
operation by this time—Also present <hi rend="italic">my respect to *person_mentioned*Eliza*/person_mentioned*</hi> and *person_mentioned*Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Pickit</hi>*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Jas E B Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p*P S. I wish the most particular care taken of my horse. I have
seen but two or three—that I would rather have since I left *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*P. S. *date_mentioned n="11-01-1826">Nov. 1st.*/date_mentioned* I waited untill the arrival of the mail before I
closed my letter confident of receiving a letter from you—but judge
of my surprise when the mail arrived not to find a letter from you—
I have received but one short letter from you since I left *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I have lost the two horses (both pacers) that I received from
*location_mentioned*Paras*/location_mentioned*—I suppose they have willingly returned to their *location_mentioned*pasturage*/location_mentioned*.
those togather with a mule lost in *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*that cost me $30—and some
other trifles to the am1 of 15 or $20 entitle me to a free pass through
the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*as every *person_mentioned*Americano */person_mentioned*has to pay the *person_mentioned*rougues */person_mentioned*an 
initionati[n]g fee—I hope since the rain I shall have better luck.*/p*
