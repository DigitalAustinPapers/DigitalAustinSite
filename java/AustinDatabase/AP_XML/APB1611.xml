go up to *location_mentioned*Sn Felipe*/location_mentioned* and will take up the papers you enclosed— *person_mentioned*Cap.n
Martin*/person_mentioned* will go up with *person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*to arrange the bonds for the money<barker_pb n="108"/>
he has loaned us, he lets us have the use of the Money three years
at 6 pr cent, and we are to give him good security.   We stated to
him that we would either give you as Security, or execute a 
Mortgage on this *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*— he says either will do—and if the loan was
for a shorter period he would not require security, you can do as
you think best in the subject.— I have noticed the contents of
your letter relative to the management of this place and am much
pleased with your ideas of Economy as they accord precisely with
my own, and afford me much satisfaction to perceive you 
determined to pay more attention to your own interest than heretofore,
a thing I have so oftened wished-— I am sensible if you continue
in the same way of thinking, a few years will entirely relieve you
from embarassment, and enable you to spend the remainder of
your life in ease and comfort. As to our future plans I have 
concluded to remain here for the *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1828">present year*/date_mentioned*; and am now employed
putting the *location_mentioned*Gin */location_mentioned*in good order for the present crop— My calculation
was if *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*joined us to have gone to *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned*, but not 
receiving an answer from him on the subject we conclude that he has
probably abandoned the idea-— I wish to get *person_mentioned*Leal */person_mentioned*and his *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*down
as soon as possible, and I want them started down while *person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*is

have little or nothing to commence housekeeping with and it they
are left there may get lost, and if brought here will be saved, and be
of service to me— I will try and get *person_mentioned*Keller */person_mentioned*to go up in his boat and
bring down everything that you may not want— I am anxious to
get as many cattle as I can and if you can procure any I will attend
to the Collection of them. The cattle that is owing to *person_mentioned*Betts */person_mentioned*I want
for *person_mentioned*Bowen */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Betts */person_mentioned*has promised me to settle with him. I have
two cows and two heifers at *person_mentioned*Robins*/person_mentioned*; and the cows I expect have
calves, and perhaps the heifers I want *person_mentioned*Leal */person_mentioned*to get *person_mentioned*Francisco */person_mentioned*and

two heifers—one cow I let *person_mentioned*Sam Pettus*/person_mentioned* have and the others are
