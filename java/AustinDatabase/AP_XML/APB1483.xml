*p**date_mentioned n="01-21-1828">Jany. 21. 1828*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr sir,*/p*

*p*I reed, your letter stating that you wish to decline serving as one
of the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento*/person_mentioned*, and feel somewhat discouraged at your 
determination—As you personal *person_mentioned*friend*/person_mentioned*, I should say you did right, but
as a friend of this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, I must say you are doing wrong—It is
very important to get good *location_mentioned*men*/location_mentioned*, and men of business in the 
*person_mentioned*Ayúntamto*/person_mentioned*. I feel no individual interest on the subject and as a mere
individual I am indifferent who are elected—but in all matters 
connected with the welfare of this *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*I cannot feel or think 
indifferently—As for myself I shall devote my whole time and attention
to the land business and have some idea of taking a trip into the
*location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned* in order to try and bring out a large number of
*person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*in a body, but I do not wish to leave the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*again, even
for a moment, untill I see the local government well organised, and
this cannot be done without putting good *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*in office*/p*

*p*I am getting very tired and worn down with the business and
were it not my duty to the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*who are here never to abandon<barker_pb n="8"/>
them, I should give up my last contract with the Govt for the 
settling of the *location_mentioned*new Colony*/location_mentioned*, and either settle myself down on a *location_mentioned*Stock
farm*/location_mentioned*, or seek some other *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*where I might hope to find 
harmony but it is my duty to persevere and for that reason, and that
alone, I will go on—*/p*

*p*you are wrong to decline serving for I think you can do an
important service to the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*as a member of the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamto */person_mentioned*but
you have a right to do as you please, tho if you are elected the law
compels you to serve—*/p*

*p*I have heard of no opposition to *person_mentioned*Ingram */person_mentioned*and I think he will
be unanimously elected I am sorry to say that *person_mentioned*Kinny */person_mentioned*has also
declined serving, tho, he is excusable for his business I expect will
compell him to devote all his time to his private affairs—I have not
thoroughly known *person_mentioned*Kinny */person_mentioned*untill *date_mentioned n="Winter - 1827 [?]">last winter*/date_mentioned* he is a usefull and
valuable man and I wish it was in my power to aid him in his
pecuniary difficulties—*/p*

*p*My *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*we must all be united and harmonious—without this
the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*never can flourish—-poor *person_mentioned*Pettus */person_mentioned*is broken up—he has been
imprudent in the highest degree—and has abused me and every
one else—if I had the means of aiding him I would freely do so—
he is in misfortune—-let that alone be remembered and all his abuses
forgotten—I send you a valuable *person_mentioned*neighbor */person_mentioned*(I hope) in *person_mentioned*Mr. Robison*/person_mentioned*,
I have nearly given him a small place merely because I think him
a good man*/p*

*p*Think better of the matter and say you will serve- My respects
to *person_mentioned*Mrs Bell*/person_mentioned* I can let you have some fig roots next year if the slips
I brought from *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*grow*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S F Austin*/person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*
