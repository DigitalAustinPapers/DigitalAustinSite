*p**date_mentioned n="11-14-1831">November 14, 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*My dear *person_mentioned*Cousin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I received yours of *date_mentioned n="11-02-1831">2nd instant*/date_mentioned* this day, and am barely able to
acknowledge its receipt. I have been very ill, and am not yet able
to leave my room, and can only set up ten or fifteen minutes at a
time.*/p*

*p*I like the idea of a <hi rend="italic">notice of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*</hi> that will make it better
known. I believe the time has now come for such a thing. <hi rend="italic">The
opposite to this, however, has been my policy, until a year or so
past.</hi> This I can better explain verbally. I should have replied
to the queries of the "*person_mentioned*London Geographical Society*/person_mentioned*" had I not
been in bed for forty five days.*/p*

*p*There is *location_mentioned*no vacant land below Brazoria*/location_mentioned* so that you cannot get
your *location_mentioned*league */location_mentioned*there. I have a place for that location in view *location_mentioned*near
Galveston Bay*/location_mentioned* which is as good as any now to be had.*/p*

*p*As to my *location_mentioned*premium land*/location_mentioned* and private affairs, you will be much
surprised to learn exactly how they stand; and will feel much 
inclined to say that I have been a faithful servant to all the *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*
except one; that one is—*person_mentioned*Stephen F Austin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*All the *location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">premium land</hi>*/location_mentioned* I hold *location_mentioned*around and below Brazoria*/location_mentioned* is in
<hi rend="italic">partnership </hi>with the *person_mentioned*heirs of my old friend, Joseph Hawkins Esq:
*/person_mentioned*and so entangled that I, myself, know not what to do with it. But,
if I enter on this matter <hi rend="italic">now </hi>I shall worry myself*/p*.

*p*I must apprize you of one thing that you may not be too much
disturbed when you notice it. The mass of the *person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*look on
*person_mentioned*all relations of mine */person_mentioned*who come here with envy and suspicion and
great jealousy. The reason is this. They <hi rend="italic">suspect </hi>that something
more will be done for <hi rend="italic">them </hi>than for those who <hi rend="italic">" bore the brunt of
the battle "</hi>*/p*

*p*I fear (judging by my own experience) that the predominant
traits in the*person_mentioned* North American*/person_mentioned* character are ingratitude, selfishness,
and avarice. The*person_mentioned* people of this Colony */person_mentioned*have caused (what I had
formerly said was impossible) a shade of misanthropy to pass over
me. I do not say that it <hi rend="italic">dwells </hi>in my mind, long at a time. But to
know ourselves is a difficult task, if not impossible, and perhaps it
is a more settled conviction than I allow. Would that it were but
the airy nothing of a fevered brain.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Gen. Terran*/person_mentioned* has arrived at *location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned*—<hi rend="italic">positive— I must see him;</hi>
and shall leave here in a carriage for that purpose, in a few days,
if able to do so.   I do not see that we can meet until I return from<barker_pb n="702"/>
the visit to *person_mentioned*Terran*/person_mentioned*.   It will be short.   I will then go to see you at
*location_mentioned*Bolivar*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I must stop, for this effort has cost me all my strength. I have
a letter from your *person_mentioned*brother, John P Austin*/person_mentioned*, by " the Boston " in at
*location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned*, dated*date_mentioned n="10-11-1831"> Oct: 11.*/date_mentioned* He says the "Nelson", with *person_mentioned*Henry's
family */person_mentioned*was to sail the *date_mentioned n="10-20-1831">20th October*/date_mentioned*, <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>.*/p*

*p*Farewell: I am truly anxious to see you. Think well <hi rend="italic">all about
this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*</hi>before you finally remove, so as to be fully contented
afterwards.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S F Austin.*/person_mentioned**/p*
