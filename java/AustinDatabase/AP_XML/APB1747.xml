*p*D Sir; Those to whom I have talked with relative to the claims
You have against them for what may be owed on their *location_mentioned*lands */location_mentioned*
consider it high time they were paid; But you know Where long
indulgence is given and a long laps of time taken place without any
demand a great many all most conclude the debt is paid. According
to My opinion the most expeditious way of getting or collecting your
claims would be to make a demand of each ones debt; if so those who
are oweing Will begin to make preparations to discharge what they
owe; You Know the nature of a great many for so long as they can
get indulgence so long will they refrain from paying I am well
apprised that there is very little money but if such property as they
have will suit you at Cash valuation—I have but little doubt but
most of them would pay— Any assistance I can give you in that
way I will Cherfully do it I am thankful to you for having the
error in the deed from *person_mentioned*Selkirk */person_mentioned*to Me rectified and whatever expences
accruing from the same You will please let me Know— In 
consequence of the flys continueing so long I could not start as soon as I
would but before long I will take the Mules due you to *location_mentioned*San Felipe de
Austin*/location_mentioned*   Yours with Esteem*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Ay. C. Buckner*/person_mentioned**/p*


*p*In conversation with some I have taken the liberty of saying it
would be better [to] pay as soon as possible otherwise they would
perhaps be compelled to do it,—and with cost to the *person_mentioned*debtor */person_mentioned*(some
require it)*/p*
