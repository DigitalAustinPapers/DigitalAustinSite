*p**location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="10-20-1826">20 Oct 1826*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Mr Stephen F Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*My dear sir*/p*

*p*There is so little intercourse between your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and this that
it is almost as difficult to communicate with you as tho you were in
the *location_mentioned*moon*/location_mentioned*—I accidentally heard by a *person_mentioned*gentlemen */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* who
had been at your *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*that you were still alive and progressing
well with your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*altho published dead several times not only in
our *location_mentioned*papers */location_mentioned*but also in the *location_mentioned*Mexican Sol*/location_mentioned* with an Obituary notice*/p*

*p*I have been myself nearly two years in *location_mentioned*Alvarado, Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* and
*location_mentioned*Nacotalpam*/location_mentioned*—in the latter place I established a *location_mentioned*Cotton Gining
Mill and press*/location_mentioned* for cleaning Cotton at the place of growth and thereby
relieving the *person_mentioned*manufacturers */person_mentioned*of the tripple expence of Carriage to
*location_mentioned*puebla*/location_mentioned*—but the *person_mentioned*Mexican Manufacturers*/person_mentioned* would not spin cotton
cleaned by machinery and the price for exportation would not pay
which compelled me to abandon the experiment with a loss of 4000$
in a year and one half hard labor*/p*

*p*I observed at *location_mentioned*Nacotalpam */location_mentioned*that the *location_mentioned*low land*/location_mentioned* abounded with live
Oak but the high price of labour and the difficultys thrown in the
way of all operations attempted by *person_mentioned*strangers */person_mentioned*will not permit the
cutting of it for exportation with advantage*/p*

*p*This timber is now in request here and should the genuine live
Oak be plenty *location_mentioned*on the banks of the rivers in your neighbourhood*/location_mentioned* 
advantage might be drawn from it unless the *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*should interpose
some impediment to its exportation Will you do me the favor
to inform me whether it is to be had in your *location_mentioned*quarter*/location_mentioned*, if so the
quantity and size, the facilitys in obtaining it—the probable cost
—whether *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*could be had there to cut it or must [it] be brought
out—the duties and impositions which might be incurred etc*/p*

*p*The present mode of obtaining it in *location_mentioned*florida */location_mentioned*is to send out strong
*person_mentioned*parties */person_mentioned*with small vessels to transport it to the shipping place then
purchase the privilege of cutting and do the work *person_mentioned*themselves*/person_mentioned*—-
The *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned*of the *location_mentioned*bajos of Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* do not value this timber
and appear to be ignorant of its durability—Care must be taken
to distinguish between the Genuine live Oak and the bastard live
Oak which is much like it but will not last—There are no doubt
*person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*with you perfectly well acquainted with it—*/p*

*p*Should there be any opening for profitable operations of any
sort in your *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*you will oblige me by giving the needful 
information I am now doing nothing—business of every kind is 
extremely dull and as I am poor with a large *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*to support I am
perforce ready to embark in any operation which offers reasonable<barker_pb n="1479"/>
advantages and with fair prospects of success there will be no
difficulty in raising sufficient capital*/p*

*p*Cotton has revived a little in *location_mentioned*England */location_mentioned*by the last advices but
will probably continue low through the year—Hides and pork and
beef if to be had at your *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*might turn to acct as also bacon
cured in the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*manner for the *location_mentioned*Havana */location_mentioned*market—The Black
beans of *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*called frijoles if raised in quantity would be an
excellent article of export*/p*—

*p*If there is any regular mode of communicating with the *location_mentioned*U S*/location_mentioned*
your *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*please inform me of it, as we shall always be happy to
hear of your welfare and to acquaint you with ours My younger
brother *person_mentioned*John P*/person_mentioned* is established here as a *person_mentioned*commission Mercht*/person_mentioned* under
the firm of *person_mentioned*Austin and Tailer*/person_mentioned* their correspondent in *location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*is
*person_mentioned*Saml. T. Coit*/person_mentioned* who will forward any letters sent to him*/p*

*p*Cordially and Sincerely your friend and *person_mentioned*kinsman*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Henry Austin*/person_mentioned*    [Rubric]*/p*

*p*I took the liberty of braking the seal of this letter and was 
agreeably surprised.*/p*
