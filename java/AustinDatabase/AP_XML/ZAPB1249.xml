<p>James Kerr to Austin, August 18, 1826. Report on topography at mouth of

<p><date_mentioned n="08-18-1826">18th August 1826</date_mentioned>—Early in the morning</p>

<p>On <location_mentioned>tide water of the Labacca</location_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I am <location_mentioned>about 10 miles up the river</location_mentioned>, from where it emties into a large
arm of the <location_mentioned>Bay </location_mentioned>—the <location_mentioned>river for three or four miles above that place,
hugs or bluffs the main land on the N. E. side</location_mentioned>—the <location_mentioned>marsh </location_mentioned>I suppose
to be about 4 miles wide. The river from the <location_mentioned>Tascosite road</location_mentioned> down
is verry crooked tho in the main bears S. E.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Adjoining the main land on the west side</location_mentioned> there is generally fine
<location_mentioned>large deep lakes</location_mentioned> that communicate with the river.</p>

<p>I have selected a <location_mentioned>Town cite</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>near the head of tide</location_mentioned>—the <location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>at that
place appears deep, and is about 25 or 30 yards wide—at the <location_mentioned>upper
end of the cite</location_mentioned>—at the Lower end, about from 40 to 60—and then
widens to distance of about 300 yards.</p>

<p>Timber is rather scarce below the <location_mentioned>Town cite</location_mentioned>—tho the land is good
to the <location_mentioned>arm of the bay</location_mentioned>, and the water not too salt for any kind of 
cooking except tea and coffee. I have concluded to survey all the land off
in Labor tracts, and I believe they will settle whather they have
timber or not—Some of which will have little or none. <location_mentioned>After the river
Enters the arm of the bay the bank on the E. side </location_mentioned><location_mentioned>bears nearly 
Southwest and terminates about 8 or 10 miles nearly S. from the shoulder
of the main land on the W. side</location_mentioned>—I saw something resembling a very
small <location_mentioned>Island </location_mentioned>from the shoulder it bears<location_mentioned> S. 16° E. the distance to it I
made 22 miles 6/10</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>Chicalet </location_mentioned>emties in <location_mentioned>about 4 miles below the road the mouth of
the Navadad </location_mentioned>is yet unknown: I am of opinion there is <location_mentioned>more good land
on the E side than on the west.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I should be very glad to get a piece from you, that is situated a
few miles below wher I intend to lay off a <location_mentioned>Town</location_mentioned>.—</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that if this <location_mentioned>Town </location_mentioned>Could be Dispensed with by
the <person_mentioned>Empresario</person_mentioned>, and the same be made by an <person_mentioned>individual </person_mentioned>it would
be much better—it will require<location_mentioned> 6 miles on a right line front on the<barker_pb n="1426"/>
river </location_mentioned>if laid out under the law, and if by individual 2 or 3 would
do—then there could be<location_mentioned> 9 or 10 Labors more</location_mentioned> etc—12 Oclock we are
now at the <location_mentioned>Town cite</location_mentioned> and I have got four of the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>to swim
the river and hunt for the <location_mentioned>navadad</location_mentioned>,—we have for 3 days seen smoke
in the direction they are going—I am now of the Opinion that the
<location_mentioned>navadad </location_mentioned>enters the bay by a <location_mentioned>separate mouth</location_mentioned>— Two men of my
<person_mentioned>Company </person_mentioned>told me They had been down the <location_mentioned>Chickolet </location_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>tide
water</location_mentioned> and that tide flowed up it <location_mentioned>3 or 4 miles above its junction</location_mentioned> with
the <location_mentioned>Labacca</location_mentioned>—all this was false—they both stated that they had
marked land in the <location_mentioned>forks </location_mentioned>of the same, and when we crossed the
<location_mentioned>Chickolet </location_mentioned>it did not corispond with the statement they had made,
and we presumed that it might be a<location_mentioned> spring branch,</location_mentioned>—so we 
neglected examining the <location_mentioned>labacca </location_mentioned>for several miles—following a course (as
they said) would take us near the head of tide on the <location_mentioned>Chickolet</location_mentioned>, and
ultimately found ourselves in the main <location_mentioned>Guadaloupe Prairie</location_mentioned>—I then
changed my course and struck the river about <location_mentioned>7 or 8 miles above the
town site</location_mentioned> where I found fine ritch first bottom, some which however
overflows— And most excellent second bottom and plenty of good
timber— The timber here prevented me from seeing with any 
satisfaction the <location_mentioned>E side of the river</location_mentioned>, further than there appeared to be
one continued bottom and well timbered near the river. It has been
misting rain while I have been writing and our <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>is rather
in confusion, and I have to fear what I have written will rather
confuse then give the information I at first expected—nothing more
until the <person_mentioned>boys </person_mentioned>return who have gone to hunt <location_mentioned>Navadad</location_mentioned>.—</p>

<p>6 Oclock men has returned and state that they traveled<location_mentioned> East about
4 miles came to a lively runing Creek</location_mentioned>, went down but a short
distance to tide, fine timber on this <location_mentioned>creek</location_mentioned>— Good bottom and
<location_mentioned>upland prairie between it and the Labacca—</location_mentioned>about <location_mentioned>2 or 3 miles
furder East they seen heavy bodys of timber</location_mentioned> and which they believe
to be the timber of the <location_mentioned>Navadad </location_mentioned>say six or seven miles distant from
this river and that the timber appeared to bear near a parallel
course with the <location_mentioned>Labacca</location_mentioned>—this the more confirms me in the belief
that this <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>and the <location_mentioned>navadad </location_mentioned>does not unite before they Get into
the <location_mentioned>bay</location_mentioned>, and very probebly their mouths are 5, 6 or 7 miles apart—</p>

<p>I start for <location_mentioned>Gonzalez </location_mentioned>in the morning—-I will only add that no
place on earth can exceed this for beauty-— The <location_mentioned>Elisian fields</location_mentioned> of
the <location_mentioned>Mehometan Paradise</location_mentioned> never was so delightsome as the 
<location_mentioned>Prairies</location_mentioned>.—</p>
