*p*Dr Sir. I received your favour of the *date_mentioned n="08-01-1831">1st Inst*/date_mentioned* by *person_mentioned*Mr Hunter*/person_mentioned*,
I am truely sorry I could not obtain the *location_mentioned*Clear Creek tract*/location_mentioned*.   I am a<barker_pb n="686"/>
*person_mentioned*stranger */person_mentioned*in the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and my health has been and still remains
so bad I have had no oppertunity of travling to make a Selection-
even one or two rides to *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*has weakened me in such a manner
I have been compeld to take two days to it. *person_mentioned*Mr Hunter*/person_mentioned* informs me
that <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Major Douglass*/person_mentioned*</hi> has made an Entry of my *person_mentioned*Negroes */person_mentioned*in your office
as his *person_mentioned*property*/person_mentioned*— Now fair, I wish to prove to you that I am, and
know, I shall always remain above <hi rend="italic">falsehood</hi>, I told you the 
*person_mentioned*property */person_mentioned*was mine Enclosed you will receive Vouchers sufficient to 
satisfy you and every other *person_mentioned*person */person_mentioned*that he does not, nor ever did own
any part of the *person_mentioned*property */person_mentioned*in my possession nor does he own one Dollars 
worth in the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*—his statement is gratuitous and false and
unauthorized by me—*/p*

*p*When the *person_mentioned*Major */person_mentioned*went to *location_mentioned*San Phillipe*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1831">last March*/date_mentioned*, I asked him to
take an *person_mentioned*Indenture */person_mentioned*that he was a *person_mentioned*witness */person_mentioned*to and prove it before the
*person_mentioned*proper authority*/person_mentioned* in *location_mentioned*San Phillipe*/location_mentioned*, when he returnd I asked him why
he had not done so— he then told me that himself and *person_mentioned*Mr S.
Williams*/person_mentioned* had a misunderstanding—but he did not tell me he had
presumed to enter the property as his, and I do hope his imprudent
conduct will not be suffered to weigh one jot against me—*/p*

*p*I also inclose you a letter from *person_mentioned*Capt- John Austin*/person_mentioned*, and I think
I may venture to say (without egotism) that they are few men that
have settled in this *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*that have behaved better, and have made
more *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*in so short a time.*/p*

*p*I have been anxious, and nothing but delicate health has 
presented me from coming to*location_mentioned* San Phillipe*/location_mentioned* long since, to comply with
the terms of the Law, *person_mentioned*Mr Hall*/person_mentioned* can inform you I have been very
sick—but I say again, as soon as my health permits I will come up
and do every thing that is necessary to make a *person_mentioned*Citizen*/person_mentioned*-— Under
those considerations I do hope sir you will reconsider my <hi rend="italic">Case </hi>and
if it is a possible thing give me the <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Clear Creek tract of land*/location_mentioned*</hi>— I
assure your sir I remain your very obednt and humble Servant*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Sylvester Murphy*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*NB you will observe the *person_mentioned*Major */person_mentioned*acted as *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*for me in clearing
the *person_mentioned*Negroes*/person_mentioned*, my health was so bad I could not attend to it, and
on the back of the Manifest he acknowledges that fact—   *person_mentioned*S M*/person_mentioned**/p*
