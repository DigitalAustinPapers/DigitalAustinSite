Orleans</location_mentioned>, as showing that no time had been lost since the receipt of
your and his letters, that the business is in its proper train
appears to have excited due interest, and as far as could judge did
not think you need fear the result etc, etc, etc., which I requested
him to communicate to you immediately on receipt and would write
further next week. A <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>, wellknown to <person_mentioned>Henry</person_mentioned>, in whom, as

act. It is possible he may be with you, as he with<person_mentioned> Mr. Butler </person_mentioned>were

the favourable impression she had previously received that she
wishes all she has was there and that she would not return upon
any account, she mentions her book on <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and was to send the
manuscript per first packet. Also requests me to pay fifty dollars,
for her, on your account, which <person_mentioned>Mr. Leaming</person_mentioned> has drawn for, and his
Draft duly paid, agreeably to your letter of advise, and the amount
placed to the debit of<person_mentioned> Mrs. Holley</person_mentioned>. It is to me highly gratifying to

commendations in which you name<person_mentioned> Mrs. H.</person_mentioned> She mentions that visit
with rapture and says would have done me good to have seen how
all enjoyed it, and quite made me wish myself and <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>could have
been of the party, as I know nothing that could give me more
pleasure than to make you a visit, but fear will be some time yet
before circumstances will admit of it which alone keeps me here.
The weather is so intensely cold, it is with difficulty I can direct my
pen (4 Degrees below zero) I beg you will let me hear from you
by every opportunity as I can but feel an intense interest in your
and<location_mentioned> colony</location_mentioned>s welfare.</p>
