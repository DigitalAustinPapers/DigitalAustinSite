arrived here with *person_mentioned*Mr Hawkins*/person_mentioned* he put me to learn the tanning trade
with *person_mentioned*Mr Blanchard his brother in law*/person_mentioned* where I staid better than 2
years but I found that him and I could not agree so I left him and
came to *location_mentioned*Lexington */location_mentioned*and have been living with *person_mentioned*Mr. Peter Hedenbergh*/person_mentioned*
learning the sadling trade which I like verry well, but I want to
see and hear from you all verry much and I want you to write to me
and be particular to send my age exactly and I want you and my
*person_mentioned*sisters */person_mentioned*to send me as many books as you can (Spanish) as I have
nearly lost my language in my own tounge since I came here, I have
discovered that by nature I . . . [blotted] sinner, but now blessed

*p**person_mentioned*Baptist */person_mentioned*Denomination in this town sensible that none but God can
pardon sins, to him I have gone and have found for myself that he
is able and willing to save My Dear *person_mentioned*Mother */person_mentioned*I want you to read
the Bible for yourself and there you will find happyness read it
with attention and prayer and the Spirit of God will enable you to
understand it, but while I have renounced the doctrines of the

blessing to my soul, but I hope, should the Lord spare me to see
you again to be able to talk more at large with you on this subject
My Dear *person_mentioned*Mother */person_mentioned*perhaps you may not like it so well that I have
changed my spiritual views of things, but the case was this, after I
came here, I became verry wicked and in the midst of this, I took
to reading the Bible and going to meeting and became convinced
that I was a sinner and without repentance, I should never see
heaven, I think when you consider that calmly you will say I have
done right and should we never meet on earth again I hope to meet
you in the realms of Glory where parting will be no more pray
for me that I may hold out faithful to the end, I want you to
