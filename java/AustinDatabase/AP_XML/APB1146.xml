*p**person_mentioned*Col. Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dear Sir Previous to your deceased *person_mentioned*father*/person_mentioned*'s visit to the 
*location_mentioned*province of Texas*/location_mentioned*—I advanced him some funds—which on his return to
this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*acknowledged—that is was partly through my 
befrending him in this instance, he was enabled to procure the greater part
of his *location_mentioned*Grant*/location_mentioned*—which has since been confirmed to you—on his return
I made him still farther advances, and supplys for his *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*—the
sum total of the advances I made him—amounts to Two hundred
and sixty nine dollars and Ten cents for which sum, on his last visits
to this *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*, he executed to me his note, at Eighteen months after
date, say *date_mentioned n="04-14-1821">April 14th 1821*/date_mentioned*—and made said note payable with interest,<barker_pb n="1334"/>
in the *location_mentioned*City of New Orleans*/location_mentioned*—It was solely at his request that the
Note was made payable at so distant a period—and after unfolding
to me his reasons—which were, that having obtained the *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*, he
would if his life was sparred, be enabled by that time, to get many
*person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*on the tract—and without doubt, would be enabled to settle
the same. He also made me handsome overtures to take a [part]
of the *location_mentioned*grant */location_mentioned*with him—but my business at that time being so 
extensive, I could not otherways do, than to decline his proposition-
Since that time, partly inconsequence of the change in the course of
trade—and having a large amount creditted out—the greater part of
which is Totally lost forever—and having to meet my own 
engagements—my situation became truly allarming to such a degree—(that
without being compelled to take the benifit of the insolvent laws)
I stripped myself of everything—and now am a[s] poor as a *person_mentioned*beggar*/person_mentioned*—
not in any kind of business—not a dollar to my name, and supporting
myself, barely, by doing jobs of writing etc., for others—since my
situation has been such—One *person_mentioned*freind */person_mentioned*has loaned me, whenever he had
—and I am indebted to him—borrowed money, which he stands in
great need off—*/p*

*p*I have been induced from my own personal acquaintance with
you, and from observations made by several of your *person_mentioned*freinds*/person_mentioned*—to
apply to you—to discharge the note—and I do feel the most 
confident assurance that after taken all the circumstances in view, I
shall not be disappointed in my expectations—you are now the 
*person_mentioned*possessor of a grant*/person_mentioned*, that was formally given to your *person_mentioned*Father*/person_mentioned*—who
stated to me previous to his death, that it was pretty much through
my intrementality, that he obtained the *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*—I am well apprized
that in consequence of the different changes of Government which
have taken place in the *location_mentioned*republic of New Mexico*/location_mentioned*, since your *person_mentioned*father*/person_mentioned*
visit to that place, that you must have had, a tedious and irksome
undertaking to have got the *location_mentioned*grant */location_mentioned*fully settled this your *person_mentioned*freinds*/person_mentioned*
have told me is the present case, and, say that you have obtained an
additional one, adjoining—My dear Sir, you have my best wishes for
you[r] success and prosperity—and had I been in possession of the
means, I would have visited your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*before this—For Heavens
sake let me hear from you as early after the receipt of this, as may
be convenient—and I conclude, by trusting with the flattering hope
that you will communicate to me the pleasing information that—This
debt of your *person_mentioned*father*/person_mentioned*s will be discharged by his *person_mentioned*son*/person_mentioned*—since whose death.
I have taken no step towards its liquidation—*/p*

*p*Expecting to have the pleasure of hearing from you—I am dear
Sir. your poverty stricken, but your warm freind*/p*
