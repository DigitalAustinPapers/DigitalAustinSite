<p>Dear Sir; <person_mentioned>Conl. José Antonio Mexia</person_mentioned> arrived a few days since
from <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned>, and requests me to advise you of same, as he<barker_pb n="630"/>
will start for <location_mentioned>Satillo </location_mentioned>in a short time for the purpose of seeing you 
relative to a colonization project, near <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned>, of which he Says
you are advised; by a <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>of yours who has an interest in it,
The <person_mentioned>Empresarios</person_mentioned>, have also interested me in the same project, for
services I had rendered them as a <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>; and they have surprised
me by their recollections of such services, which are most generally
forgotten If you can further their views it will not only benefit
your <location_mentioned>Collony</location_mentioned>; but an old friend also. However when you are made
acquainted with the views of the <person_mentioned>company</person_mentioned>, which seems to be 
composed of the first class of <person_mentioned>citizens </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> you will be better able
to judge of the influence it may have upon your <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>; which I
would not have you to injure for any personal interest I could have,
in the other   nothing new or interesting</p>
