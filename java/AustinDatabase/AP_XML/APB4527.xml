*p**location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="02-10-1833">February. 10th 1833*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*I presume to address you on a subject which has occupied, more
or less my attention for the last two years, viz, a permanent residence<barker_pb n="927"/>
in the *location_mentioned*Texas Country*/location_mentioned*. Circumstances have prevented me from 
carrying my wishes into effect thus far, and being now at *location_mentioned*N. Orleans
*/location_mentioned*where I have been residing for the *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1832">last three months*/date_mentioned*, my wishes
strongly combining with the facility of reaching the *location_mentioned*Spanish 
Country*/location_mentioned*, prompt me to carry my desire into effect. When I left *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*
where my life thus far has been passed, to visit this place, I was
induced to believe from representations made me, that I should find
a lucrative practice in the profession of the Law in this city. Altho
I may not perhaps have given it fully a fair experiment, yet a strong
desire to live in a climate less fatal, and a country, less expensive, as
my means are limited, induce me to seek *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*as a country more
congenial in most respects to my wishes, and I flatter myself to my
future prospects in life also. Had I have determined upon settling
in your *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, when I left*location_mentioned* N York*/location_mentioned*, I should have brought to you
introductory letters from your *person_mentioned*cousin*/person_mentioned*, I believe, with whom I am
well acquainted, having boarded with him upwards of a year—I
mean the *person_mentioned*Mr. Austin*/person_mentioned*, who is with a *person_mentioned*Mr. Harmony, a Spanish 
Merchant of *location_mentioned*N York*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*— *person_mentioned*Mr. A.*/person_mentioned* has told me that he intended settling
in the *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*soon himself. *person_mentioned*Mr. Meigs*/person_mentioned* family of *location_mentioned*N York*/location_mentioned*, (whom I
have often heard speak of you and *person_mentioned*Cap. Austin*/person_mentioned*,) I am intimately
acquainted— I presume you were formerly acquainted with my
Father, *person_mentioned*Amasa Jackson*/person_mentioned*, who married the daughter of *person_mentioned*Oliver Phelps
of *location_mentioned*Suffield, Connecticut*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*. My *person_mentioned*Father */person_mentioned*was for many years a *person_mentioned*Merchant*/person_mentioned*
in *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*, and became unfortunate a short time before his death
which happened about seven years ago. Should your answer to this
communication be at all favourable, so as to justify my visiting your
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, I will endeavor to visit it immediately, and will bring with
me from this place such letters as will be satisfactory to you. I have
mentioned the above, thro, fear that you may [receive] many 
applications of this sort, from *person_mentioned*worthless persons*/person_mentioned*, as the idea is somewhat
prevalent that the *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*is resorted to by those, and those only from
the *location_mentioned*U States,*/location_mentioned* who are ruined in property and character. To be 
candid with you Sir, I would say, that I am poor—, willingly, ardently
willing to engage in any honourable occupation for a livelihood.
Misfortune has hitherto attended my steps, and being yet in the 
meridian of life, I am very solicitous in your new and rising colony, to
lay the foundation for future success and happiness. If you can
afford toe the least gleam of hope, I will embrace it with eagerness
and will endeavour to the extent of my limited ability to promote
the interests of your *location_mentioned*flourishing colony*/location_mentioned* in every practicable
manner—*/p*

*p*May I then request you, Sir, to address me at this place as soon as
may be practicable, imparting to me such information in reference
to my locating in your *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, that I may act upon it with due
deliberation.   Naught, but the most serious obstacles will prevent me<barker_pb n="928"/>
from becoming a *person_mentioned*resident */person_mentioned*of that land, so that I feel myself prepared
to suffer many trying inconveniences. I have attended to my 
profession, which has been that of the Law, tho I have had in the last few
years experience in mercantiling pursuits-— I am now engaged in
the *person_mentioned*profession of Law*/person_mentioned* in this place. I shall await the recpt. of your
Letter with some impatience, and I must again beg you to excuse
the liberty—   I have taken in troubling you on this subject.*/p*
