<p><location_mentioned>Northumberland</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="08-20-1830">August 20th 1830</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Under date of <date_mentioned n="08-14-1830">14th Inst</date_mentioned>: I had this pleasure at length: and 
conceiving it right you should know whatever relates to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I with
pleasure communicate to you such information as comes under my<barker_pb n="466"/>
notice— Since last writing you, I have met a <person_mentioned>french gentleman</person_mentioned> of
the name of <person_mentioned>Sorbe</person_mentioned>, who has a <location_mentioned>House </location_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>tampico</location_mentioned>— for <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1830">two years</date_mentioned>
past he has been principally in the <location_mentioned>Interior</location_mentioned>, and I think has a
tollerably correct knowledge of the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>-—he tells me the <person_mentioned>Barings</person_mentioned>
have made a very extensive purchase of land from the<person_mentioned> count of——-
</person_mentioned>his name I forget, who is now in <location_mentioned>Italy</location_mentioned>, they gave for it three millions
of Dollars, and that it is (if I am not mistaken) equal in extent to
<location_mentioned>150 leagues square, it comes close to Saltillo, and embraces Parras,</location_mentioned>
he says the purchase includes a number of <location_mentioned>villages</location_mentioned>, thó the precise
<location_mentioned>boundaries </location_mentioned>he could not give me— they are settling it fast growing
cotton, and are about erecting a <location_mentioned>cotton manufactory</location_mentioned>—a gentleman of
the name of <person_mentioned>Sterrett </person_mentioned>(I think) is their <person_mentioned>agent</person_mentioned>—I thought none but
<person_mentioned>Mexican Citizens</person_mentioned> could hold land in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>!—</p>

<p>When I see you I shall want particular information relative to
<location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Exeter</person_mentioned>s grant</location_mentioned>, as I wish to set aright a <person_mentioned>gentleman of very 
conspicuous standing in<location_mentioned> S. Carolina,</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who writes " I have received much
information about <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I hold some shares in the<person_mentioned>Coahuila, and
Texas company </person_mentioned>of which<person_mentioned> Dennis A. Smith of <location_mentioned>Baltimore </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>is the <person_mentioned>agent</person_mentioned>,
I dined a short time ago with <person_mentioned>Mr. Poinsett</person_mentioned> who says the <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>is
regular and valid—" either this <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>is very much misled, or I
am, but how is [it] possible <person_mentioned>Mr. Poinsett</person_mentioned> can be mistaken ?</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>owners of this <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>of course want to make a speculation of
it—honestly if they can etc.—but under any circumstances is it not
our policy to let them take their own road; for each <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>they (that
is <person_mentioned>Wilson and others</person_mentioned>) make, or each tract they sell, excites precisely
so much Interest in the minds of the <person_mentioned>people of the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, in
favour of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>In my last letter I acknowledged receipt of yours of <date_mentioned n="07-04-1830">4 July,</date_mentioned> and
mentioned that I should be at <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>with my <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>the last
of <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1830">October </date_mentioned>and hoped <person_mentioned>Ingram </person_mentioned>would have as promised, a <location_mentioned>place of
shelter</location_mentioned>—in readiness</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. Rhoads—Fisher</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Colonel Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned><location_mentioned> Austin Texas</location_mentioned> care
of <person_mentioned>Gen: Wm. Robeson</person_mentioned>  <location_mentioned> New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>
