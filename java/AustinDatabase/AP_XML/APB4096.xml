*p**date_mentioned n="12-03-1830">Dec. 3. 1830*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Mr E. R. Weightman*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dr Sir *person_mentioned*Mr Brush*/person_mentioned* has entered his *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*I perceive that the
*location_mentioned*29th, 30 and 31st leagues on Trespalacios*/location_mentioned*, as you have returned them
in the book of that Creek *location_mentioned*cross the trespalacios creek*/location_mentioned*   I know not<barker_pb n="549"/>
whether this will interfere with the place *person_mentioned*Mr Brush*/person_mentioned* wants—the *location_mentioned*29th
league*/location_mentioned* is deeded to the *person_mentioned*heirs of Richard Graves*/person_mentioned* as you have returned
it and cannot be altered—the *location_mentioned*30. and 31. are still vacant*/location_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Brush*/person_mentioned*es
can cross the *location_mentioned*bayou */location_mentioned*if it will not interfere with other tracts*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Bowman */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*William*/person_mentioned*s League on the East of Colorado*/location_mentioned* next
*location_mentioned*below *person_mentioned*Betts */person_mentioned**/location_mentioned*is not run as I gave you the memorandum, and the 
consequence is that the *location_mentioned*quarter which was selected by *person_mentioned*John McLarren*/person_mentioned*
*/location_mentioned*will be nearly all taken on the front by *person_mentioned*Bowman */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned*—
their League was deeded in the *location_mentioned*old colony*/location_mentioned* and the lines cannot now
be altered— Agreeably to the deed it begins *location_mentioned*at Betts lower corner
thence ST. 62E 5500 vars thence S. 28E to a point from which a line
S. 62. W. to the river */location_mentioned*will make one League— by refering to the
plot you will see that this will cut off more than *location_mentioned*half the front of
*person_mentioned*McLarren*/person_mentioned*'s quarter*/location_mentioned*— I sent you the notes of this league and am
surprised that it was not run in conformity— it must be so run
and the fraction between it and *person_mentioned*E. Hall*/person_mentioned* must then be calculated and
plotted in a quarter it will be in a triangular shape with a very
narrow front on the river— Explain this to *person_mentioned*McLarren */person_mentioned*without
delay so that he can choose another quarter if he doesnt like to take
the same after the correction is made— I have not made an exact
calculation but think that *person_mentioned*Bowman */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*will leave but a
*location_mentioned*few hundred yards above *person_mentioned*Hall*/person_mentioned*s upper corner—*/location_mentioned* As I have said this
tract must be run as it was first deeded, no alteration can be made at
all in it*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S F Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I shall start on the *date_mentioned n="12-15-1830">15 of this month*/date_mentioned* positively— Send me the
notes or begining of *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Brush*/person_mentioned*es tract*/location_mentioned* is you can do so—that I may
finish his deed*/p*
