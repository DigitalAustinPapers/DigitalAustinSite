*p**person_mentioned*Col S F Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*My Dear Sir I have just recd yours pr*person_mentioned* D[r.] Archer*/person_mentioned* and am
sorry to find the disappointment as to the Dearborn vexes you so
much—as matters have turned out it was perhaps a fortunate 
circumstance the cold winter storm for a week past would have rendered
the journey dangerous if not impracticable—*person_mentioned* She [Mrs. Holley]*/person_mentioned*
recd your letter stating your intention to go to *location_mentioned*Anahuac */location_mentioned*and see her
on your return, before I left She therefore determine [d] to remain
at *location_mentioned*Bolivar */location_mentioned*until my return with my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and then if you were at
*location_mentioned*St Felipe*/location_mentioned* to go up with me on horse back if I could not get a 
carriage—   I have now arranged for one here if wanted on my return*/p*

*p*I have been detained here*date_mentioned n="11-22-1831"> six days*/date_mentioned* by the storm, there is no
chance of the Nelson getting in until it be over— we are now 
informed that *person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned* has returned to *location_mentioned*Matamoras*/location_mentioned*, and conclude
you will not now leave *location_mentioned*St Felipe*/location_mentioned* until quite well. However severe
your disappointment in not seeing *person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*I think it is better than
that you should have made the journey for travelling in this bad
weather would in all probability have killed you— you have no
doubt better information as to his departure than we have If it
be true that he has removed the *person_mentioned*Garrison */person_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Galveston Island */location_mentioned*and
Suspended the collection of duties till *date_mentioned n="04-xx-1832">April */date_mentioned*as report says I see no
reason to regret his visit or sudden departure, it gives time to observe
the moving of the waters I am told *location_mentioned*Jalisco */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*two other states
*/location_mentioned*have withdrawn from the *location_mentioned*union*/location_mentioned*, if so there may be a general break
up next thaw and *person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*will have enough to look after at home— I
have seen your letter to *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*—you ought not to permit these matters
to worry you so much The *person_mentioned*bablers */person_mentioned*are mostly *person_mentioned*men of little 
influence*/person_mentioned* the substantial part of the *location_mentioned*community */location_mentioned*are not disposed to
take any steps in public matters without your previous 
approbation—The *person_mentioned*talkers */person_mentioned*in the case of*person_mentioned* Capt Doon */person_mentioned*were mostly the *person_mentioned*shopkeepers*/person_mentioned*
and *person_mentioned*whisky drinkers*/person_mentioned*. I arrived here a few days after and
defended the conduct of the *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*who had done no more than his<barker_pb n="714"/>
duty and had shown more lenity than would have been shown in
such a ease in any other country*/p*

*p*When the case was fairly understood all the *person_mentioned*reasonable men*/person_mentioned* 
condemned *person_mentioned*Capt Doons*/person_mentioned* conduct—*/p*

*p*I wish much to have *person_mentioned*Mrs Holley */person_mentioned*see the *location_mentioned*upper country*/location_mentioned* as she is
already preparing a work for publication on her return and I wish
her to have a fair opportunity to describe the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and to see
you long enoug[h] to get your ideas as to the representation best
calculated to make such impression on the public mind as will suit
your views of policy—*/p*

*p*The affair of *person_mentioned*Hall */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Phelps */person_mentioned*is like to do much mischief—
which ever way it goes if *person_mentioned*Hall */person_mentioned*gets the *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*it establishes the
principle that an individual may occupy the *location_mentioned*property */location_mentioned*of another
without the warrant of any public authority or judicial act which
might lead to much mischief and great disconfidence in titles generally- 
If *person_mentioned*Phelps */person_mentioned*has vitiated his title no act of *person_mentioned*Hall*/person_mentioned*s can make
it good, but it strikes me as very dangerous to permit an individual
to appropriate the labor of another to himself <hi rend="italic">before any judicial
act of forfeiture is had</hi>—if permitted on one pretense now it will
soon be resorted to on another. I have already heard men speak
of denouncing *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*on the ground of forfeiture for non settlement,
having a *location_mentioned*league */location_mentioned*of the *person_mentioned*Hall family */person_mentioned*in view on which they say not
a tree has been cut— who can foretell the effect of such proceedings
upon the public mind here and in the *location_mentioned*US*/location_mentioned* where the Matter will
not be understood and no doubt be much misrepresented— I am
very anxious about my *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, the cold storm still continues.
The moment I get them housed I shall come to *location_mentioned*St Felipe*/location_mentioned* and visit
the *location_mentioned*upper country*/location_mentioned* if the weather will permit to look out a retreat
for the summer I would not keep my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*at *location_mentioned*Bolivar */location_mentioned*through
such a Season as the last for all *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*it would be a certain
sacrifice of the lives of some of them-— I think somewhere near
*location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Cole*/person_mentioned*s*/location_mentioned* or *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Chrisman*/person_mentioned*s*/location_mentioned* will from all accounts be healthiest and safest
there being a strong population there and in case I get the *person_mentioned*Swiss
families */person_mentioned*I have sent for I will place one of them there to commence
a *location_mentioned*vineyard*/location_mentioned*— *person_mentioned*J W[e]stall*/person_mentioned* has this moment come in with 
information that the Nelson is off the *location_mentioned*Bar */location_mentioned*and my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*on shore at
*location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Captn Chas*/person_mentioned*es*/location_mentioned* all well—   It rains hard but I start at once*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*H. Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p*My fingers and Ideas are froze up*/p*
