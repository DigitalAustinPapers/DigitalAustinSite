<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>I recd nothing from you or anyone from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by the last mail
your last letter <date_mentioned n="01-25-1831">Jany. 25</date_mentioned>.    I am really uneasy that I got nothing<barker_pb n="607"/>
by the last mail. I wrote you on the <date_mentioned n="12-19-1830">19 of last month</date_mentioned> a long letter,
also to <person_mentioned>Luke [Lesassier]</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Rhoads Fisher </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Hunter</person_mentioned>, which I
hope you have recd. My principal object here is to try and prevent
harm—if I succeed in that I shall do a great deal—this you can say
to the <person_mentioned>Ayto</person_mentioned>. to whom I intended to have written by this mail, but
will write a long letter by next [mail].</p>

<p>[I have] sent some <location_mentioned>papers </location_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Dn Ramon</person_mentioned> [with the] request to
send them to you, they [v]omit -<hi rend="italic">fire </hi>against the <person_mentioned>present 
administration</person_mentioned>. The death of <location_mentioned>Guerrero </location_mentioned>appears to have given new vigor,
and a vindictive rage to the <person_mentioned>fallen party</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Bustamte </person_mentioned>can truly say,
as <person_mentioned>Calvits negro</person_mentioned> did the night his drunken <person_mentioned>master </person_mentioned>shot him <hi rend="italic">"I
have taken my head in my hand" </hi>But, how many storms have
passed away with a simple <hi rend="italic">válgame Dios.</hi> Thank God <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is
beyond the reach of these internal hurricanes and I hope they never
will reach there, tho this depends mainly on the people of that
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. <hi rend="italic">Keep harmony and Union among yourselves</hi>—and all is
safe.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Private</hi>—I wrote by last mail that your petition was granted—
since then I have recd the testimonio and will send it and all the
others by <person_mentioned>Fernando Rodrigues</person_mentioned> who starts in a few days for <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The power of attorney is effected in union with myself—the <location_mentioned>lower
line is ten leagues from the West—</location_mentioned>the <location_mentioned>upper on the heads of the
Brazos and Colorado</location_mentioned>: I wish the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>[B]oss</hi> [Teran?],</person_mentioned> to take a part
in this—if he will, all is safe. I am operating on a pritty large
scale, for a taciturn and noisless man, but I have no other object in
view that [than] the genl prosperity of <hi rend="italic">us all</hi> and particularly of
this <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>. Keep all this to yourself: The fate of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, in some respects depends on the month of <hi rend="italic"><date_mentioned n="05-xx-1831">May next</date_mentioned></hi>—untill
then look back and take council from the past a[nd keep] all quiet—
you can shew [parts of?] the letter to <person_mentioned>Luke </person_mentioned>if you think prop[er but]
to no one else and he must not mention or breathe it to anyone.</p>

<p>Remember me affectionately to <person_mentioned>Sarah </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Eliza </person_mentioned>and my <person_mentioned>little
nephew </person_mentioned>and write me how <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>is, you say nothing of him—I
presume he is still at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Westall</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned>. Send the enclosed by first
opportunity.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>Tell <person_mentioned>Mancha </person_mentioned>[that] her <person_mentioned>son </person_mentioned>is well and    *    *    *</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Sam M. Williams</person_mentioned></p>
