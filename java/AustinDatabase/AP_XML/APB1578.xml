*p*Sir A desire which I have for some time entertained to have a
knowledge of the distinguishing characteristics of the *location_mentioned*Province of
Texas*/location_mentioned* has been of late much increased by the perusal of some of
your letters published in the *location_mentioned*papers of this country*/location_mentioned*. I write at this
[time] to request a minut description of the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*but the more
particularly of that part of the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*in which you are established
I am under the impression that you have obtained of the *person_mentioned*Mexican
Government*/person_mentioned* an extensive *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*which you are now Colonizing,
For the sake of brevity I will condense the subjects of my enquiries
into the following questions. How far is your *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*from the
*location_mentioned*Gulf Coast*/location_mentioned*? Is the country Mountainous or level. How Large are
the*location_mentioned* Rivers Colorado*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*Brasos*/location_mentioned*? Do they in any considerable 
degree afford facilities for navigation? What proportion do the*location_mentioned* rich
lands bear to the poor or barren lands*/location_mentioned*? I have taken the Idea that
*location_mentioned*lands along the rivers*/location_mentioned* are extremely fertile but that the *location_mentioned*intermediate
hills*/location_mentioned* were dry and barren. Am I right? Is it a *location_mentioned*timbered Country*/location_mentioned*
What is the extent of your *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*? Is it Surveyed? Is the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
in general explored and Surveyed? What enducements can you
hold out to a *person_mentioned*Surveror */person_mentioned*who is a complete master of the business in
all its branches? Are you in want of a person to assist you in 
making your map of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*? Are the *location_mentioned*unoccupied lands*/location_mentioned* in the
hands of the general Government of *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*as in this *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*?
What Route would you recommend to *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*from the *location_mentioned*States on
the Ohio River*/location_mentioned*. What time is required to Sail from your *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*to
the *location_mentioned*port */location_mentioned*nearest to the *location_mentioned*City of Mexico*/location_mentioned*. I have now given you some
of the leading points uppon which I desire information. There
may be others which may occur to you if so I shall be grateful
for their insertion. I have an intention of visiting your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*if
the prospects shall appear favorable. I am a *person_mentioned*Surveyor */person_mentioned*and in that
business would wish to be employed either in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*or elsewhere in<barker_pb n="86"/>
the *location_mentioned*Mexican Provinces*/location_mentioned*. I am aware that the number of my enquiries
may intrude uppon your leisure but you may rest assured that in
giving me the desired information you will confer a verry 
particular favor and not only on myself but a verry considerable 
number of my *person_mentioned*acquaintances */person_mentioned*who have some Idea of emigrating I must
request that you will answer as early as convenient*/p*
