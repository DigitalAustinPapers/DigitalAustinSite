<p>Dear Sir I thank you for your letter of the <date_mentioned n="05-04-1827">4th May last</date_mentioned>, which

<person_mentioned>Coin. Nicholas,</person_mentioned> nor have I recd of late any communication from<person_mentioned> Mr.
Cox</person_mentioned> concerning <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have no objection to a division, and will send out an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>if I
can, but my present impression is that I shall not be able to engage
a suitable one for some time,<person_mentioned> Mr. Sanders</person_mentioned> has a large <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and
newly settled <location_mentioned>in the woods</location_mentioned>, their interests, requires his presence at
<location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, it will not be convenient for him to leave home so long—</p>

<p>I am like yourself destitute of means to appropriate anything at
present towards your <location_mentioned>settlements</location_mentioned>, and must wait untill something
more propetious presents itself—What do you think of the 
propriety of sending an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>England </location_mentioned>to make sales there of the
<location_mentioned>lands</location_mentioned>? great number of <person_mentioned>emigrants </person_mentioned>are now leaving that <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>,
<person_mentioned>artizans </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>manufactures </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>farmers</person_mentioned>,   may be something could be<barker_pb n="1675"/>
effected that way, If your title is such as could be disposed of—
Some <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>having other business might undertake this so as
not to make the expence burthensome—please let me hear your
views</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Sanders</person_mentioned> thinks your <location_mentioned>province </location_mentioned>being without the<location_mentioned> U. S</location_mentioned>. there
would be no great inducement to cultivate sugar on act of the duties
unless you had some other <location_mentioned>market</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Would there be any office in the civil administration of your 
provincial govt, that would suit <person_mentioned>Coln. Nicholas</person_mentioned> and him the office ?</p>

<p>My second son <person_mentioned>Edmund </person_mentioned>is placed in a <location_mentioned>house of business</location_mentioned> at
