*p**date_mentioned n="02-19-1831">Feb. 19, 1831.*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr. Sir*/p*

*p*Without the honor of being known to you, I have flattered myself
that the nature of the subject of this communication will be some
excuse for the liberty I have taken in trespassing a few moments on
your attention.*/p*

*p*There are in this vicinity, a number of *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*who are desirous
of removing to a *location_mentioned*southern climate*/location_mentioned*; and on my suggesting to them that
the country of the *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*afforded very considerable inducements,
I have been requested to procure, if possible, further, and more
recent information in regard to that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*. I have therefore been
induced to solicit this information, sir from you, not being 
acquainted with any person resident in that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*We are apprised that it has heretofore been the practice to give to
every actual *person_mentioned*settler */person_mentioned*a certain quantity of land—we would be glad
to know whether this practice is still continued—<hi rend="italic">in your own tract
of *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*</hi>and if not, whether it is the case in other parts of the
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and if so what quantity of land is now given and what will<barker_pb n="598"/>
be the expense of procuring the deed and the survey, and whether
there are good and convenient *location_mentioned*tracts of country*/location_mentioned* yet unappropriated.
If land is not given at this time in any part of the *location_mentioned*province*/location_mentioned*, on what
terms can it be purchased ?—What is the face of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—how
watered, and how furnished with building materials? What are the
advantages in a commercial point of view and what are the 
productions of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*? What are the religious priveleges—-are there
many wealthy *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*—and is slavery now tolerated ?—All 
accounts that we have received concur in representing the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*as
healthy, still I should be glad to know what encouragement a 
*person_mentioned*physician */person_mentioned*would be likely to meet with.*/p*

*p*I have acquainted myself pretty extensively with the culture and
manufacture of the grape, and have had some practical experience in
that business, I am therefore anxious to know whether the soil and
climate of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*is adapted to its successful cultivation, I should be
glad also to be informed whether as yet the silk-worm has been 
introduced into the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Some with whom I have conversed on the subject of removing
have expressed fears in regard to the *person_mentioned*indians*/person_mentioned*—please to say 
something in dissipation of such fears, if they are groundless.*/p*

*p*There are about a Dozen *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*here who will probably remove
*date_mentioned n="Fall-1831">next fall*/date_mentioned* if satisfied in regard to the state and coditions of the
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and many more will remove the following season if pleased
with their accounts of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Please to send us, if convenient, a copy of the constitution of your
general government, and one for the *location_mentioned*province*/location_mentioned*, if you have a separate
constitution, as we do in the *location_mentioned*States*/location_mentioned*; and also a copy of your code
of laws, as those interested, are anxious to obtain all the information
possible in regard to your civil institutions.*/p*

*p*The above, together with any other information, whether written
or <hi rend="italic">printed </hi>you may please to send us? will be thankfully received
as a very special favor by*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Col. —— Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*P. S. I do not know the regulations of the*location_mentioned* Post office*/location_mentioned*, but any 
expenses incurred in that line will be very cheerfully met by*/p*
