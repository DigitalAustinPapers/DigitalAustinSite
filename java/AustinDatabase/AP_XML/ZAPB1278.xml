<p>Austin to Saucedo, September 11, 1826. Discouragement of the colonists over  uncertainty  concerning  slavery.    Indians.</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="body">

<p>I inclose to your <person_mentioned>Lordship </person_mentioned>an original letter of the <person_mentioned>Cherokee Chief
Richard Fields</person_mentioned>, informing me of the movements of the <person_mentioned>Comanches</person_mentioned>,
and other particulars.</p>

<p>I had already received, a few days since, a similar notice from a
<person_mentioned>Chickasaw Indian</person_mentioned>, and I am convinced that, <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1827">next fall</date_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>
will unite to make a grand effort upon the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>particularly that
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>We are not well prepared here to resist an attack. <person_mentioned>More than one
half of these people</person_mentioned> are awaiting the decision of <person_mentiSoned>Congress </person_mentioned>in regard
to their <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned>, as they intend to leave the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>if their 
emancipation is decreed. They are already making preparations for their
journey. The remainder of the <location_mentioned>settlers </location_mentioned>are so disheartened that they
have no energy to make an effort. Therefore, if the <person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned>are 
emancipated the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>must not depend upon the assistance of this
<person_mentioned>militia</person_mentioned>. It is to be feared that the tardiness in making provisions
for the friendly <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>will dissatisfy them; which would be 
unfortunate, as 100 <person_mentioned>Cherokee warriors</person_mentioned> are decidedly superior to 500
<person_mentioned>Comanches</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>God and Liberty.</p>
