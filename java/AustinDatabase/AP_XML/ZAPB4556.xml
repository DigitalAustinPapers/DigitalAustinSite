<p>Austin to Henry Austin, April 19, 1833. Approves application for organization of Texas as a State, and thinks must proceed to organize anyway if petition is refused. Report that Government is sending army to Texas to keep it from revolting from Mexico.   This very objectionable.</p>

<p>Copy of a letter from <person_mentioned>Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> to <person_mentioned>Capt. Henry Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p>Dated <location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="04-19-1833">April 19th 1833</date_mentioned> :</p>
<p>To <person_mentioned>Capt. H Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir—I leave <date_mentioned n="04-20-1833">to-morrow</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>on the state Government
mission— I go with considerable—I may say—strong hopes of
success— The course taken by the convention, is the true one I
think— The memorial for admission as a state is respectfully
[sic] and dignified and based upon the law of the <date_mentioned n="05-07-1824">7th May 1824</date_mentioned>. and
I can see no just reason why any offence should be taken [to] it by
the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, nor why it should be refused— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>can not do
any longer without a <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>—things have been so disjointed
ever since the <person_mentioned>military authority</person_mentioned> began to interfere with the civil,
and with <person_mentioned>citizens</person_mentioned>, that nothing can set them to rights again but a
<person_mentioned>state Government</person_mentioned>— I approve fully of the application for 
admission as a <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>and I think it will succeed— The consequence of a
failure will no doubt be war—</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>can not evidently get a[lo]ng without a <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and if there
should be no means of obtaining one with the approbation of 
<person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>she must form one of herself in the best way she can. I have
always been opposed to hasty and imprudent measure but if our 
application fails, I shall say we have exhausted the subject so far as it
can be done by mild steps, and that a totally different course ought to
be adopted, for we can then take a firm stand for rights that were
respectfully petitioned for and unjustly detained— The sum and
substance of the whole matter is that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>must have a <person_mentioned>state 
Government</person_mentioned> nothing else will quiet this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>or give any security to
persons or property, and nothing else will be agreed to [by] me as
the <person_mentioned>representative of the public wishes</person_mentioned>— I think I shall succeed—
I was opposed to putting our <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, into operation until we first
obtained the sanction of <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>Such a step could not have been
justified on solid grounds, but if <hi rend="italic">after </hi>our application we get no
remedy, I shall advise an immediate organization under the law of
<date_mentioned n="05-07-1824">7th May 1824</date_mentioned>, and a second application for admission, <hi rend="italic">as organized</hi>—
That also failing we shall have to do the best we can—I say that I
shall advise this—I mean in case the situation of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>
continues to be as it now is—for at this time we are in anarchy and
there will be no middle course left between total ruin and an 
immediate organization—if our application should fail—</p>

<p>There is a rumor, and it appears to be well founded, that the most
of the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>are to be sent to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, for the purpose of getting them<barker_pb n="954"/>
out of the way so as to prevent future revolutions in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—it is
said they are not sent with any unfriendly feelings to the <person_mentioned>people
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> &c— This is what letters from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>say. now if a 
considerable army is sent here, no matter with <hi rend="italic">what feelings</hi> the result
will be a collission—that is if they attempt to Govern in a military
way In this event the whole <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>ought to unite at once and
expel or kill the whole of them—- It is not a correct or a sound
course of policy for the Govt, to make <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>the recepticle of her
disorderly <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>— But every care and prudent step should be
adopted to avoid any collission, and the first aggression must not
be on the part of the people—and above all things there must be
no opposition to the collection of duties, for that is a right which the
Govt, has— Let us violate no law—nor any just rights of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>
and adhere closely to the principle of seeking a peaceable remedy,
<hi rend="italic">that failing</hi>—-I am then ready for war or any thing— So soon as
I am convinced that there is no hope of success I shall return as
quick as possible by water—I will try and keep the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>away if
possible— No man in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has been more in favor of peace than
I have—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>old settlers</person_mentioned> and all persons will suffer much by a revolution,
or a war—but if there is no other remedy, I am for going into it
fully, and united, make a business of that at once— I however
think there is no danger— I believe we shall be admitted as a state
and that all will go on smoothly</p>

<p>This is my last effort to serve <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, if I succeed I shall be happy,
and will try to enjoy some comfort in future and have nothing to
do with politics or public business— If however I fail, and war is
the result, I will take a hand in that, and enter the ranks as a
soldier of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I pay my own expenses, and expect the trip will be costly—but
I do it freely and cheerfully and shall consider the money and
labor better employed than any I ever spent in my life— Please
remember me to <person_mentioned>Doct. Phelps</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, Hall, and all your 
<person_mentioned>neighbors </person_mentioned>and assure them that no effort shall be spared on my part to
get a <person_mentioned>state Govt</person_mentioned>, and to keep away war and revolution from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—
but if they <hi rend="italic">must </hi>come, I will take my full share and stand by the
<person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>to the last— Love to your dear <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>and may heaven
bless you all—   Affectionately your <person_mentioned>cousin</person_mentioned><person_mentioned>S  F   A</person_mentioned></p>
