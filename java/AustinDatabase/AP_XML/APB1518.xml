*p**date_mentioned n="03-31-1828">March 31. 1828*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Brother and Sister,*/p*

*p*On my return from the seat of Govt of this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*last winter I
found your letter transcribing *person_mentioned*Learning*/person_mentioned*s letter relative to the
*location_mentioned*claim in New Jersey*/location_mentioned*, and*person_mentioned* Brother James*/person_mentioned* and myself without delay
executed a power of attorney in due form to *person_mentioned*Mr. Learning*/person_mentioned* and sent
it direct to him in *location_mentioned*Philadelphia*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I know nothing of the title deeds for *location_mentioned*land in Virginia*/location_mentioned* that you
speak of—I remember having seen two parchment deeds for land
in that country in *person_mentioned*father*/person_mentioned*s writing desk about the time he removed
to *location_mentioned*Hercuianium*/location_mentioned*—but what became of them or wheither they were
for the tracts you allude to I know not. perhaps he took them with
him in the desk to *location_mentioned*Little Rock*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*and myself will give any power of attorney that may be
necessary to prosecute our claim to the *location_mentioned*Mine á Burton*/location_mentioned* property
but we have not the means to advance money neither can we do it
at any short period*/p*

*p*You are doubtless ere this informed by *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*s letters of the
important change that has taken place in his situation, he was
married on the *date_mentioned n="03-20-1828">20 of this month*/date_mentioned* at this place to *person_mentioned*Miss Eliza Martha<barker_pb n="29"/>
Westall*/person_mentioned*—he has made a good choice and I think has secured his
domestic happiness—we are trying to arrange matters to set him
and *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* up in the Mercantile business in which there is
a good prospect of success—tho their begining is very small he
expects to be in *location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="05-xx-1828">May */date_mentioned*or *date_mentioned n="06-xx-1828">June*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I once had a *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*who could spare a few moments every six or
eight months to drop a line to her unfortun[ate]? absent, brother—
Where is she? has time swept me from her remembrance, or has
she too many cares, or too much amusement to allow a half hour
to past remembrance—I feel almost cut off from the world, but still
something in her own handwriting would be acceptable, how many
*person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*has she, how are they disposed of—what are her future
calculations She can tell me a thousand things that will be 
interesting, for she can write nothing that will be otherwise, It has been
more than 18 months since I have recd a line from her own 
handwriting—I never expect to converse with her otherwise than by
letter—time rolls on rapidly, tell her to improve it while she can
in chatting once more on paper to her brother-—*/p*

*p*We move on here slowly, but quietly—this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*will present a
*location_mentioned*second Eden*/location_mentioned* to posterity—wheither we shall find it such or not
depends on the progress of emigration and improvements—*/p*

*p*Farewell—give my love to all the *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*and to all old *person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*
and particularly to *person_mentioned*Elias Bates*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and other *person_mentioned*relations*/person_mentioned**/p*
