*p*Dear sir   Presuming on the acquaintance I had with you while

a transcript of a Judgmt in my favour against *person_mentioned*Peter Tyler*/person_mentioned* who
formerly lived on *location_mentioned*white River*/location_mentioned* in this *location_mentioned*Territory */location_mentioned*and whom you may
have perhaps seen, while a resident here—he *person_mentioned*Tyler */person_mentioned*has been 
reported as dead and letters of administrad granted on his *person_mentioned*Estate*/person_mentioned*—
but in consequence of the unsettled way in which he left his busness
nothing has been obtained by the *person_mentioned*administr */person_mentioned*to satisfy the debts he
was owing—many persons on *location_mentioned*white River*/location_mentioned* where he formerly lived
believe he is still living, and residing in some part of your 
*location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*—should this be the case he no doubt has property sufficient
to satisfy the balance due me of the judgement. If *person_mentioned*Tyler */person_mentioned*is still
living and in your *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*as reported— and you can do any
thmg to secure this debt, it will lay me under obligations to you,
which I shall always be happy to have it in my [power] to 
reciprocate. I dislike to trouble you with this business and should not have
done it—were it not for the assurance of our mutual friends *person_mentioned*Mesrs.

be received with great satisfaction by us—we know the claim to be
a just one, and believe that *person_mentioned*Tyler */person_mentioned*has not acted as a good *person_mentioned*citizen*/person_mentioned*
of your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*should act with regard to it,— Our respective 
*person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*are all in health— we have seen a *person_mentioned*gentelman */person_mentioned*by the name of
