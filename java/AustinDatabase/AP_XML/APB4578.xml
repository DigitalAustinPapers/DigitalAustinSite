*p*Dr Sir, I have unexpectedly met with a passage to *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* and
sail *date_mentioned n="06-01-1833">tomorrow*/date_mentioned*—the trip by land would have been severe on me at this
hot season and I am rather weak from a dysentery—tho it is getting
better. I refer you to my letter to the *person_mentioned*Ayto*/person_mentioned*. as to news etc.—all goes
well here now, but a darker squall than seemed to be gathering
when I arrived, I have not seen lately. The prospects are all changed
and they now are bright. *person_mentioned*Fisher */person_mentioned*is reappointed and goes on soon
with only a few *person_mentioned*troops*/person_mentioned*. I expect he will go by land through *location_mentioned*San
Felipe*/location_mentioned*, and I particularly recommend that the past be forgotten—he
is an*person_mentioned* officer of the Govt*/person_mentioned*, and he will now get on very well and be
usefull to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*—of this I have no doubt*/p*.

*p*I hope you will have the *location_mentioned*office */location_mentioned*business attended to and the 
surveys regulated and all other matters—also the title for *location_mentioned*the tract
that Brown Surveyed at the foot of the mountains east side of
Colorado*/location_mentioned*—both the ones on the other side can be taken by *person_mentioned*Valle*/person_mentioned*
or not just as you please.*/p*

*p*Write me to *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, care of *person_mentioned*Wm. S. Parrott*/person_mentioned* so that he can take
out the letters and keep them untill I arrive.*/p*

*p*remember me to *person_mentioned*Mrs. Williams*/person_mentioned**/p*
