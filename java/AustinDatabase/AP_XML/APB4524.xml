*p*Dear *person_mentioned*Col*/person_mentioned*.—*/p*

*p*Let this serve to introduce to your acquaintance, my brother *person_mentioned*Henry
Anthony*/person_mentioned* who wises to become a *person_mentioned*Mexican Citizen*/person_mentioned*.— He visits *location_mentioned*San
Felipe*/location_mentioned* for the consequent donation of land which I assured him he
would get by so doing.— My brother *person_mentioned*Jacob */person_mentioned*who has been here for
some time is not well enough to go up at present and I therefore
send the certificate of his having taken the constitutional oath etc.
and also his name to a blank for a petition which I believe or hope
will answer the same purpose as if present— I do not send you the
<hi rend="italic">Cash </hi>required on those occasions, but you can either draw on me
immediately or wait a short time when it will be more convenient.
I send you the proof of the first form of the Remonstrance in Spanish
which has been waiting a week for correction. If this should be
sufficiently correct, I suppose the other part can go to press without
being sent to *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned*, as it is important they should be printed
immediately. The balance will be in type by the return of my
*person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*Remonstrance (Translated) gives great satisfaction
here. You will see from the *location_mentioned*paper*/location_mentioned*, what I have said on the subject
of holding the convention at *location_mentioned*San Antonio*/location_mentioned*. I hope I shall hear from
you frequently and soon—*/p*
