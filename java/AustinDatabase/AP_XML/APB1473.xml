*p*Dr Sir,*/p*

*p*I am happy to find myself once more amongst my large *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*
after so long an absence*/p*

*p*On the *date_mentioned n="02-03-1828">3 */date_mentioned*and *date_mentioned n="02-04-1828">4 of Feby next*/date_mentioned* the genl election comes on in the
*location_mentioned*several districts*/location_mentioned* for one *person_mentioned*Alcalde*/person_mentioned*, two *person_mentioned*regidores */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*aldermen */person_mentioned*and one
*person_mentioned*sindico procurador */person_mentioned*for the *location_mentioned*whole colony*/location_mentioned*—these *person_mentioned*officers */person_mentioned*compose the
*person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*municipal corporation*/person_mentioned*—great power is given to
this *person_mentioned*corporation */person_mentioned*by the laws, and much depends on getting in good
and intelligent *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Kinny */person_mentioned*has positively refused to serve as *person_mentioned*Alcalde*/person_mentioned*, and I think that
*person_mentioned*Ira Ingram*/person_mentioned* will be the best we can get—he is compelled to live in
this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*and it will not be as injurious to him to be absent from *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*
as some others—in my opinion he is well qualified for the office
and will do credit to the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*The *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*must meet
once a month at this place which will be a little inconvenient for
those who live at a distance*/p*

*p*I think *person_mentioned*J. H. Bell*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Wm Morton*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*L. K. Kinny*/person_mentioned* ought to be
the two *person_mentioned*regidores */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*sindico Procurador*/person_mentioned*—or if either of these
will not serve *person_mentioned*M. B. Nuckols*/person_mentioned* who lives here and is a very good and
intelligent man.*/p*

*p*The nearer they could be elected to this place the better for they
ought to meet at least once a month and sometimes of tener, and
there is no kind of compensation allowed to them by law—Should
the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*be unable to act from sickness or death etc the *person_mentioned*alderman*/person_mentioned*
who had the highest vote takes his place which makes it still more
important to elect good men—*person_mentioned*Rawson Alley*/person_mentioned* has also been spoken
of and he would make a good one also *person_mentioned*T. M. Duke*/person_mentioned*, If you do not
wish the appointment (which I presume you do not) for it will
put you to great trouble owing to the distance you live from here, I
think that *person_mentioned*Kinny */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Morton */person_mentioned*for *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">regidores </hi>*/person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Nuckols */person_mentioned*for <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Sindico
Procurador*/person_mentioned* </hi>will be the best we can get—Write me your opinion on
the subject and wheither *person_mentioned*Ingram */person_mentioned*for <hi rend="italic">Alcalde</hi>—*person_mentioned*Kinny */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Morton*/person_mentioned*
for <hi rend="italic">regidores </hi>and Nuckols for <hi rend="italic">Sindico Procurador</hi>, will suit the<barker_pb n="2"/>
*person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*in that *location_mentioned*quarter*/location_mentioned*—if not write me what ticket you think will
suit them—let us try and be united and harmonious in this election
I have sent the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*of that *location_mentioned*district */location_mentioned*full instructions on the
subject of conducting the Election—the forms etc and a *location_mentioned*circular*/location_mentioned*
which will give you an idea of the nature of the new system—*/p*

*p*remember me to *person_mentioned*Mrs Bell*/person_mentioned*, it is a long time since I have seen her
and I feel anxious to visit you and see you all once more. When the
election is over I shall be free and will come and see you—*/p*
