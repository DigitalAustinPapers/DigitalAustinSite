*p*Austin to James F. Perry, July 14, 1830. Hostility to Americans in Mexico subsiding.   Orders various books.   Is to be elected to the legislature.*/p*

*div1 type="body"*

*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*In addition to the memorandum I sent you in my letter of the
other day, I wish you to get me copies of the constitutions of<barker_pb n="452"/>
*location_mentioned*Columbia*/location_mentioned*, of*location_mentioned* Buenos Ayres*/location_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*Chili*/location_mentioned*, of *location_mentioned*Peru*/location_mentioned*, and what is called
the <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Bolivia*/location_mentioned*n Code</hi> or constitution given by *person_mentioned*Bolivar */person_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*upper Peru*/location_mentioned*
or *location_mentioned*Bolivia*/location_mentioned*, they are all in Spanish— I think you can get them
at some of the bookstores, or perhaps from some individual who
has been to those *location_mentioned*countries*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*In place of the scarlet jacket which I wrote for get me a blue
clothe vest to suit the surtout and not a scarlet one — bring me a
good raisor or two.*/p*

*p*you must be particular if you come by *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*to have contracts
with the *person_mentioned*servants */person_mentioned*or the *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*at *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*will interpose some
difficulties.   If you come by water contracts are also necessary.*/p*

*p*I hope you may get here by *date_mentioned n="12-01-1830">1 of Decr*/date_mentioned* for it is possible I may
have to leave here in the *date_mentioned n="Winter - 1830">winter*/date_mentioned*, the mail of today brings me letters
stating that I shall be voted for at *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*to represent *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*in the
*person_mentioned*state Legislature, */person_mentioned*if so I shall be elected of course, for in this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*
I shall not loose a vote, and but few if any at *location_mentioned*Goliad */location_mentioned*and 
*location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*they have started me at *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*the whole thing originated
with the *person_mentioned*native Mexican population*/person_mentioned* of that place and *location_mentioned*Goliad*/location_mentioned*—
I had no idea, and no wish for such a thing I cordially detest
politics in any *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and our affairs in *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*have been so 
entangled by some one (and it is suspected by an *person_mentioned*american*/person_mentioned*) that I
dread entering within their reach— True it is that the prejudices
against *person_mentioned*north Americans*/person_mentioned* are subsiding in *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, but still, there
are some remnants of bitter feeling left among the uninformed who
believed that *person_mentioned*Poinsett */person_mentioned*was the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* Government, and that all 
*person_mentioned*north Americans */person_mentioned*were connected with his intreagues— The situation
will be an unpleasant, and perhaps a critical one, but an honest
and prudent course has always carried me safely through many
difficulties in this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and I have faith that it will continue
to do so.*/p*

*p*The election is next *date_mentioned n="08-xx-1830">month*/date_mentioned*— The *person_mentioned*Legislature */person_mentioned*meets *date_mentioned n="01-01-1831">1 of 
January*/date_mentioned*— there are two *person_mentioned*members */person_mentioned*only from all *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*: tho after this
year we shall have several more owing to an increase of population,
and the ratio is to be new moddled next session.*/p*

*p*The result of the election will be published after it is over— 
contrary to the custom in the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* but little is said about elections and
there is but little electionering in this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, a *location_mentioned*candidate */location_mentioned*who says
any thing himself, to influence votes can be deprived of his seat—
this has prevented open and public electionering—*/p*

*p*"Remember me to *person_mentioned*Mr Learning*/person_mentioned* and see about the *location_mentioned*Maps*/location_mentioned*— I 
perceive they are out, I want a number on rolers— they are for 
presents to *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned*and of course I wish for the best— *person_mentioned*Tanner */person_mentioned*will
realise more by that *location_mentioned*map*/location_mentioned*, than by any thing he ever published in his
life and I rejoice that he will do so—   tho I need some cash to pro-<barker_pb n="453"/>
cure a few choice Spanish, and English books of a literary and 
historical character to try and improve my mind which needs it much,
for during the ten years I have spent in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, but few books have
come within my reach—*/p*

*p*farewell may heaven bless you and land you and *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*and the
*person_mentioned*young one[s]*/person_mentioned* safe in the "*location_mentioned* wilds of Texas*/location_mentioned* "*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="07-14-1830">July 14 1830*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*I am greatly in need of <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Waits */person_mentioned*State papers</hi>, published in *location_mentioned*Boston*/location_mentioned*.
I had them in *location_mentioned*Missouri */location_mentioned*but lost them in *location_mentioned*Arkansas*/location_mentioned*— A number 
subscribed for them at the *location_mentioned*Mines */location_mentioned*and I think a set might be got there
cheap.— In my other letter I wrote to you to get me a blue undress
Military surtout with a standing collar trimmed with black silk
cord—yellow bridle bits yellow spurs and yellow stirrups, these I
need very much and a pair of boots*/p*
