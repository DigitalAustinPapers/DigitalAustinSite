<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>I ask leave to introduce to your acquaintance my son <person_mentioned>Mr. N. D.
Ellis</person_mentioned>, and to acknowledge the receipt of your favor by my friend<barker_pb n="329"/>
<person_mentioned>Col A Winston</person_mentioned>. I wish to say to you that we have been led into an
error by a proclamation of the <person_mentioned>Mexican president </person_mentioned>as to the 
liberation of <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned>. Perhaps he only meant <person_mentioned>bound servants</person_mentioned> such as has
been by the civil Law for 200 years, but you know such is the sensitive
feelings of the <person_mentioned>Slave holders</person_mentioned> on that subject, that the least agitation
will deter them from emigration, and I really begin to believe with
you that it is shortly to be a great evil among us. for it has 
prevented me from sending on <person_mentioned>negros </person_mentioned>to my son in Law <person_mentioned>James N.
Smith</person_mentioned> until it is too late to make a crop. The first objection is the
expense of sending them on, at this late season, and a person to 
superintend them, the second is, every practical <person_mentioned>planter </person_mentioned>knows it is too
late to make a crop even to <hi rend="italic">rent land</hi>; (the worst of all evils) but
the 3rd is one which I know will plead my excuse to you; when I
state my own situation, for it seems one misfortune never comes
alone but (as <person_mentioned>Shakespear </person_mentioned>says) treads on the heels of another; 2 or
3 months after the date of the last receipt of the payt of <person_mentioned>W. Pettus</person_mentioned>'s
debts, (as this will show) I had the<date_mentioned n="01-12-1830"> 12th instant</date_mentioned>, a large portion of
my cotton crop burnt to ashes <location_mentioned>in the warehouse of the <person_mentioned>Messrs. Harts
</person_mentioned>in the city of New Orleans</location_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr. J. N. Smith</person_mentioned>'s with it. I refer
you to my son for the amt. and the details; (<hi rend="italic">not insured</hi>) Please
accept my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Richard Ellis</person_mentioned>.</p>
