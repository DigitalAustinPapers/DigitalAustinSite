to deliver this to you as he goes through *location_mentioned*Mine á Burton*/location_mentioned*. I have nothing very material to write—having some surveying to attend to in
this *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*I accompanied the *person_mentioned*surveyor */person_mentioned*and have just returned from
a fishing and oystering trip, and think my health (which has not been
very good) is improved—we procured a great abundance of fish, oysters and wild fowl and have had very fine weather*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* have commenced building a *location_mentioned*Gin */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*a little
below the head of tide water on this river, about 40 miles by water
from this place*/location_mentioned*—he has commenced in the woods and intends to be
a <hi rend="italic">first rate *person_mentioned*farmer*/person_mentioned*</hi> we neither of us own any *person_mentioned*negros */person_mentioned*and have to
depend on hireing*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned* progresses very well, tho not very rapidly, I am very
well satisfied that you have not removed here, the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned* is very
new yet, and I think *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* can do better where he is for the present than he could do here—-we have but little commerce as yet—tho
must have a great deal in a few years—*/p*

*p*The reports in the*location_mentioned* news papers */location_mentioned*relative to overflow, Sickness, etc,
etc, etc, in this *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned* are all false—we have very abundant crops—*/p*

*p*I have just heard of *person_mentioned*Wm Perry*/person_mentioned*s murder—if his *person_mentioned*murderer */person_mentioned*comes
within my reach he shall be secured and lodged in *location_mentioned*Nachitoches jail*/location_mentioned* —
I am told that his name is *person_mentioned*Hill*/person_mentioned*, is it the same *person_mentioned*Hill*/person_mentioned* that worked for
*person_mentioned*Bryan*/person_mentioned* and married one of the *person_mentioned*Doggits*/person_mentioned*? Send me a particular description of him and the *location_mentioned*news paper*/location_mentioned* that offers the reward and if he
comes here I may be able to get some one to take him back to *location_mentioned*Potosi*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I am daily expecting something from you and *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned* relative
to the *location_mentioned*Mine a Burton Estate*/location_mentioned*—you must do the best you can, it will
be many years before I can see *location_mentioned*Missouri*/location_mentioned*, or *location_mentioned*brother*/location_mentioned* either*/p*<barker_pb n="1239"/>

*p*I am getting tired of Colonization affairs and hope before long to
close my business and settle on a *location_mentioned*farm*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*Remember me to your *person_mentioned*Husband*/person_mentioned* and assure him that nothing
would give me more real pleasure than to see him in this *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*as
soon as his business will permit, he will find us in the *location_mentioned*woods*/location_mentioned*-—and
<hi rend="italic">poor</hi> The enterprise I undertook is better calculated to enrich those
who come after me than to benefit myself—I have the labor to perform and the seed to sow, but my *person_mentioned*successors */person_mentioned*will reap the harvest—*/p*

*p*Give my respects to *person_mentioned*Saml Perry*/person_mentioned* and to *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned* and his *person_mentioned*wife*/person_mentioned* and my
other *person_mentioned*acquaintances*/person_mentioned*—

*p*N. B. I am very much fatigued and have a headache which must
be my excuse for such a scrall as I now send you—
What are the *person_mentioned*Jones*/person_mentioned* doing? where is *person_mentioned*Mrs. Henry Elliott*/person_mentioned*?— What
has become of *person_mentioned*James Austins children*/person_mentioned*?— What is *person_mentioned*G. Hammond*/person_mentioned*
doing? I received a letter from *person_mentioned*Arch. Austin*/person_mentioned* in *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Henry*/person_mentioned*
had gone to *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*—are *person_mentioned*Horaces children*/person_mentioned* doing well ? where is his
*person_mentioned*wife*/person_mentioned*? etc etc*/p*

*p*This *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned* mouths into the *location_mentioned*wild ocean*/location_mentioned* without any *location_mentioned*bay*/location_mentioned*, and the
breakers are roaring within Eighty yards of me—there is a good
*location_mentioned*two story frame house*/location_mentioned* and some *location_mentioned*cabins */location_mentioned*here and there is at this time
8 feet water over the bar Salt water is produced here by digging 10
feet so strong that 5 gallons of it will make one of salt, and by digging 4 feet good fresh water is found in abundance,—Mosquitoes are
troublesome at this time— I have discovered in my fishing trip that
the *location_mentioned*west end of Galveston bay*/location_mentioned* comes *location_mentioned*within four miles of this place*/location_mentioned*,
and *location_mentioned*within 200 yards of a deep tide water creek that empties into the
Brasos*/location_mentioned*, so that 200 yards digging will open an *location_mentioned*inland water communication*/location_mentioned* with the *location_mentioned*Harbor of Galveston*/location_mentioned* where ships of 400 tons
can enter with safety—I shall spend some time on the *location_mentioned*coast*/location_mentioned*—it is *location_mentioned*75
miles from here to where I live*/location_mentioned* at present tho I intend to remove
about *location_mentioned*25 miles by water above here, 10 by land*/location_mentioned*—*/p*
