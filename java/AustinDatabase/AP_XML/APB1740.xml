*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*When we left *location_mentioned*Sanfelepe*/location_mentioned* a few days Since with [a] view of going
to the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* for the purpo[se of] bringing out Men and means to
prosecute [our] business in the *date_mentioned n="Fall-1829">fall*/date_mentioned*,—we thought we took with us
the good wishes of the good people of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*,—and having
(previously to leaving town appointed our friend *person_mentioned*[Walter] C. White
*/person_mentioned*our *person_mentioned*genl agent*/person_mentioned* with means [to] liquidate and Settle any just claim
that might remain against us, and having given the *person_mentioned*alcalde */person_mentioned*notice<barker_pb n="241"/>
of this in writing and also Verbally assuring him that *person_mentioned*Mr W. C.
White*/person_mentioned* would settle for us any just claim without a Suit, we beged
him not to issue in any case without first knowing from our *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*to
the contrary,— Now Sir mark the conduct of the *person_mentioned*officer*/person_mentioned*, we had
but Just got here, when *person_mentioned*S Miller*/person_mentioned* appears with a process from the
*person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*for 15.00 in favr *person_mentioned*Scoby*/person_mentioned*,—*person_mentioned*Miller */person_mentioned*was asked—did *person_mentioned*Walter G
White*/person_mentioned* Know of this? he answered No; and demanded Ten Dollars
Milage when we Knew (through himself) that he was on other 
Business at *person_mentioned*Doctr Nuckolls*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*Dobson */person_mentioned*and *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Lewis*/person_mentioned*'s place */location_mentioned*Hence we
consider such charges grievous, oppressive and unjust, Knowing that
the Law says when an *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*is on duty to different persons the 
Milage shall be apportioned among them—and Knowing it to be the
duty of the *person_mentioned*alcalde */person_mentioned*not to issue [process for] a person before he has
proof that an [effort] or essay has been made to settle by compromise
etc but our *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*we are persuaided would have Satisfied *person_mentioned*Mr Scoby
*/person_mentioned*without a Suit,—it is painful to us dear Sir, to trouble you in this
way knowing the multiplicity of your business Concerns, but [as]
the Complaints agt the administration of Justice throughout the
*location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*are loud and numerous, and we have on all occasions used
our best influence to quiet and pacefy the minds of the people 
advising always to make allowances and Judge with as much liberality
as posible and try to Settle their differences at home, but a galled
Horse Winces,—it is distressing and perplexing, and our minds are
now devided about proceeding further in our Views and opperations,
which are of too extensive a nature to be subjected to such 
regulations as we are now under; it is principally with this View, that we
now address you, and ask your friendly advice and Candid opinion—
Shall we go on and trust and hope that those grievances will be 
removed, or shall we wind up and close and make the most we can of
what we have,—there are numbers of our friends and acquaintances
waiting our opinion on which depends their removal to the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
or not [we ver] y seriously lame[nt] the present state [of] things,—
pray [write] emedeately on rect of this, and *person_mentioned*Mr W. [C] White */person_mentioned*will
forward it on to Care [of] *person_mentioned*Dunlap*/person_mentioned*—here, So that it will reach [us]
without delay*/p*
