*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="10-25-1828">Oct. 25. 1828*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I rec.d your kind and affectionate letter the other day and sent it
down to *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*—he came up a few days since with his *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and
is now here—he informs me that he wrote you by way of *location_mentioned*Orleans*/location_mentioned*
just before he left *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I truly sympathise with you on the loss of your *person_mentioned*infant*/person_mentioned*—tho I have
seen so much trouble and misery amongst my fellow beings that I
doubt wheither we should too deeply grieve for the departure of
innocence and purity from this wretched world— There is another
and a better one, to doubt it would be to convert the shadows which
surround us in this life into the most horrible darkness*/p*

*p*I send this by *person_mentioned*Mr Brown*/person_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*St Charles*/location_mentioned* and he has only a few
moments to wait being now on his way therefore cannot write you
a long letter. I wish you to inform me what plan you have adopted
or think of adopting as to *person_mentioned*Joel */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Austin*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*is about engaging in the Mercantile business and I think
will soon be enabled to do an extensive and profitable one—*/p*

*p*I am as yet at work at colonization and shall necessarily be tied
down here for some time to come—it is a troublesome business and re-<barker_pb n="136"/>
quires much more preserverance and patience than any one can
imagine who has not tried it—   But I will go through with it—*/p*

*p*You ask me how I like my *person_mentioned*sister in law*/person_mentioned*— I am very well pleased
with her, and think *person_mentioned*Brown */person_mentioned*has made a happy choice— they live
very happily together and have the prospect of an heir this winter
or *date_mentioned n="Spring - 1829">early in the spring*/date_mentioned*, tho I presume he has written you relative to
his family matters—*/p*

*p*I wrote you to send me the *location_mentioned*old Lead book*/location_mentioned* kept by *person_mentioned*Ballard */person_mentioned*during
the year I worked the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*in partnership with *person_mentioned*Butler*/person_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*M.r Ballard
*/person_mentioned*knows that nothing was cleared that year. I sent a statement of the
a/cs. to *person_mentioned*Butler*/person_mentioned*, but he pretends to claim (as I am informed) Many
thousand Dollars I know not exactly what kind of a man *person_mentioned*Ballard*/person_mentioned*
is but have always thought him an honest man and I do not think
he will forward *person_mentioned*Butler*/person_mentioned*s unjust claims to injure me— I wish *person_mentioned*Mr
Perry*/person_mentioned* to sound him as he may deem prudent on the subject— The
truth is that the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*cleared nothing the year *person_mentioned*Butler */person_mentioned*and myself
worked them in *person_mentioned*partnership */person_mentioned*and I therefore owe him nothing on
that score*/p*

*p*This *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*has been very healthy this *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1828">year */date_mentioned*and we are getting on
pritty well in every respect— I will pay you a visit some time but
cannot tell when, it shall be as soon as possible— I know you
cannot visit me and I do not wish you to take such a journey— It
is too long, and exposed to some dangers— Remember me 
affectionately to *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* and all old *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*acquaintances*/person_mentioned**/p*
