*p*I came here with my Cart, *person_mentioned*black man*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*two <hi rend="italic">white</hi> strange Gent*/person_mentioned*,
who overtook me on the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, on the evenig of—*date_mentioned n="11-01-1826">1st*/date_mentioned*—found all
well, and in good spirits—In a few minutes a man by the name of

orders from *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*etc but the people were still alarmed. *person_mentioned*Dewitt*/person_mentioned*
Often told them they must not oppose Govt and that all orders
coming from Govt must and should be obeyed, for fear some

returned on the way to the *location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*when the *person_mentioned*Colo*/person_mentioned* Asked me to go and
