*p**location_mentioned*Comargo  */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="09-24-1829">Sept 24th  1829*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Col. S F Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*My deae Sir I wrote you from *location_mentioned*Matamoros*/location_mentioned*, advising you of my
arrival there with a steamboat to commence the navigation of this
*location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*. *location_mentioned*Bravo del Norte*/location_mentioned* I have been up nearly to *location_mentioned*Revilla*/location_mentioned*, where I
found the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*so dangerous in low water that I did not think it
prudent to proceed up at *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1829">this late season.*/date_mentioned*— At the 
commencement of the wet season the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*May be Navigated quite to *location_mentioned*presidio
del Norte,*/location_mentioned* but as that season is now nearly passed, I shall confine
My trips for the *date_mentioned n="Winter-1829">winter */date_mentioned*to this place*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Between Matamoros and this*/location_mentioned*, the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*is navigable and Safe
but I have great reason to apprehend there will not be business
enough to support the boat We have by law the privilege of taking
up lands but the *location_mentioned*unoccupied lands on this River*/location_mentioned* are not worth
having.*/p*

*p*I was induced to embark in this operation by the hope of 
retrieving my ruined fortune and of laying a foundation for an estate for
my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*by Securing a large tract of land. Before leaving the
*location_mentioned*US*/location_mentioned* I laid before *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*a Memoir on the *location_mentioned*western boundary*/location_mentioned* pointing
out the advantages of exchanging the *location_mentioned*land beyond the Rocky 
Mountains for those between this River and the U S*/location_mentioned* and suggesting the
Mode in which it might be effected had I a Sure conveyance I would
Send you a copy of it— I have reason to believe there is now a
negociation pending on the Subject-
Now I have reason to apprehend that my present effort will not
realize the expected advantages and some reason to fear it may result
in a failure—in which case, I should only be able to save my self
from ruin by taking the boat to some place where She could be
Sold or employed to advantage-*/p*

*p*Can you inform Me whether the *location_mentioned*laguna */location_mentioned*which is laid down on the
*location_mentioned*Map */location_mentioned*as *location_mentioned*extending from Brassas St lago to the Colorado River*/location_mentioned* is
Navigable with four feet water, if not by what rout could a 
Steamboat be transported *location_mentioned*from the Mouth of this river to Galveston bay
or to New Iberia*/location_mentioned* Is there sufficient wealth produce and travel in
your *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*to employ a steamboat Could I obtain in your 
*location_mentioned*neighbourhood */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*a tract of good land*/location_mentioned* in perpetuity either through you or by
application to the State*/p*

*p*I wish extremely to have an interview with you but it is impossible
for me to leave the business I am engaged in even for three days—
I shall leave this in a week for *location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned*and return from there
with a cargo immediately—during the *date_mentioned n="Winter - 1829">winter */date_mentioned*I will be alternately<barker_pb n="260"/>
*location_mentioned*here */location_mentioned*and at *location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned*as frequently as business May offer for the
boat and probably Make 2 or 8 trips pr month—*/p*
