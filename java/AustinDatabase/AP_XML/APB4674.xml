*p**person_mentioned*Mr James F Perry*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dear Sir. On my arrival here I found a *person_mentioned*Mr Bradley*/person_mentioned* here with a
note of our friend *person_mentioned*Col Austin*/person_mentioned* for something upwards of 700$ which
has been due some months, and which would have been paid ere this
but from the necessity of providing funds for him in *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*After his arrest he wrote to me and requested me to dispose of his
property to provide means for him, he has also sent you a letter of
attorney for the same purpose. As yet I have not found it necessary
to make any sale nor do I believe it will be necessary for I can 
continue to raise means for all his wants in *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, and he has authority
to draw for another thousand dollars over and above what he has
drawn for, and this note is the only one he has out—*/p*

*p*I find that at this place there is no money to be had at the moment.
*person_mentioned*Mr White*/person_mentioned* at *location_mentioned*Columbia */location_mentioned*is likewise destitute if you have as much as
500$ by you I wish you would advance, it, and should you require it
in the *date_mentioned n="Winter-1834">winter */date_mentioned*I can return it to you, and if you should want in *location_mentioned*New
Orleans*/location_mentioned* I can manage to furnish it to you there, if you have it I
should like to hear from you immediately—I can get along with the
sum mentioned.*/p*

*p*I am happy to state that there is a wonderful reaction in favor of
the *person_mentioned*Col.*/person_mentioned* and altho some what tardily I am proud in the Conviction
that his *person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*are disposed to do him justice.*/p*

*p*Present me kindly to your family.*/p*
