<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Leona Vicario [Saltillo]</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="01-13-1831">13 Jany. 1831</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. S. M. Williams</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,   I arrived in this <location_mentioned>city </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="01-16-1831">last evening, </date_mentioned>after an unpleasant
journey <location_mentioned>through the mountains</location_mentioned>, owing to the cold, which has been<barker_pb n="585"/>
more than usually severe. My <person_mentioned>credential </person_mentioned>was presented to day and
refered to the usual <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>who will report tomorrow, and I take
my seat <date_mentioned n="01-14-1831">next day</date_mentioned>. I am in good quarters, with <person_mentioned>Padre Musquis</person_mentioned> and
the member from the <person_mentioned>Partido of Monclova (Canales)</person_mentioned>—up to this
time, great harmony has prevailed in the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>among the
<person_mentioned>members</person_mentioned>, they all appear pleased that I have come on. I hope these
appearances may be all solid realities. I have had the pleasure of a
visit from el <person_mentioned>Cura de Austin, y Vicario gral de Texas, Doctor Miguel
Muldoon</person_mentioned>—he has been here about a week. I am truly pleased with
him, he is a very intelligent and gentlemanly <person_mentioned>man</person_mentioned>, and quite liberal
in his ideas. I must believe that if the general <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, wished to 
harrass us, they would not have sent a man as <person_mentioned>vicar genl of Texas</person_mentioned>, who
is so liberal and so enlightened, on religious subjects. Sin embargo,
there are some things to be bourne in mind—he has always been the
warm and bosom friend of <person_mentioned>Genl Teran</person_mentioned>, and as I am told of <person_mentioned>Alaman</person_mentioned>—
but he is also a great favourite of both <person_mentioned>Agustin </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Govr Viesca</person_mentioned>, who
have known him intimately several years, and speak highly of him,
he puts up at the <person_mentioned>Govrs</person_mentioned>—he has been accustomed to the best society
in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and in <location_mentioned>Europe</location_mentioned>, the Society of the <person_mentioned>nobility </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>gentry</person_mentioned>,
and I fear he will think us rather a rough set in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I should
prefer that he take lodgings with you, on his first arrival, untill a
<location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>can be prepared for him, and there ought to be no delay in 
preparing one. <person_mentioned>Col Butler</person_mentioned> has recommended him to me in the strongest
terms, and I do assure you that I am greatly pleased with him. He
says that there will be a very considerable imigration from <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>
to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>composed of the <person_mentioned>first families of the <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in point of wealth
and standing, querie—is it not probable that the <person_mentioned>white portion of
the Mexicans </person_mentioned>look towards <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, as a retreat in case the <person_mentioned>indians of
the South </person_mentioned>should finally succeed?—pueda ser. <person_mentioned>Jorge [Fisher]</person_mentioned> is
writing a book at <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>to prove to the Govt, what the <person_mentioned>American
Settlers</person_mentioned> and<person_mentioned> Col A—</person_mentioned>— are. The ground he takes is that he was 
persecuted by a faction of which I was the head—that the mass of the
<person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>are my <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>and are opposed to me, that the publication
by the <person_mentioned>Ay</person_mentioned> to is all false etc—that the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>are bad immoral, and
only want a pretext to rebel etc—I give you this as I have heard it
from a person who was some time in <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>— Should any
such publication be made, I would recommend that the <person_mentioned>Ayto</person_mentioned>. call the
whole <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>together in masse by a notice published in the <location_mentioned>Gazette</location_mentioned>,
and when they meet, that they appoint a <person_mentioned>president </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>secretary</person_mentioned> to
give form to the meeting—that <person_mentioned>Fisher</person_mentioned>s publication be then taken up
and a committee appointed to answer it in the name of the whole
<location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>. My character belongs to the <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>and any unjust attack
upon me situated as I now am, is in fact an attack upon all This
will shew that it is not a <person_mentioned>faction</person_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="586"/>

<p>The opinion here is that the present administration will sustain
itself, tho on this subject I have not as yet been able to get much
information.</p>

<p>I am told that <person_mentioned>Teran </person_mentioned>is a very credulous man, and believes 
everything he hears, if so <person_mentioned>Jorge </person_mentioned>may mislead him for a time, but if the
<location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>stand to their posts, he will soon be undeceived.</p>

<p>This letter must only be seen by a few. After I take my seat I
will write to several and give whatever news there may be of interest,</p>

<p>Be very cautious about inserting remarks in the <location_mentioned>Gazette</location_mentioned>, say
nothing about <person_mentioned>Muldoon </person_mentioned>in the paper as yet.</p>

<p>By <person_mentioned>Chambers </person_mentioned>I will write you more fully— he will leave in
about a week, he is in trouble—. the <person_mentioned>Tribunal </person_mentioned>has thrown obstacles
in the way of receiving him as a <person_mentioned>lawyer</person_mentioned>— they are of a frivolous
nature. My opinion of <person_mentioned>Chambers </person_mentioned>is very good—he can be useful!
in that <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.   What has passed will be of great service to him,</p>

<p>I send the grey horse by <person_mentioned>Jose Luis</person_mentioned>, and the other horse and mule
by <person_mentioned>Chambers</person_mentioned>—I should loose them here—</p>
