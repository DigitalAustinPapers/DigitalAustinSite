persue relative to the *person_mentioned*commissioner */person_mentioned*accords with my opinion intirely
but my extreme bad health I fear will prevent my adopting the course
you have suggested*/p*

*p*Permit me to inform you that the success which has crowned
your late efforts on the subject of our land petition has gained you
much applause among the *person_mentioned*inhabitants of *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*. But I fear it
will work a great injury to yourself at least, for new favours in the
opinion of the multitude beget new obligations, and as emty 
acknowledgments are the only tribute they expect will be exacted for the
important servises you have rendered, you may expect future 
aplications in abundence and perhaps I shall be the first to draw on your
benevolence *date_mentioned n="03-01-1829">yesterday */date_mentioned*one of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants of this *location_mentioned*vicinage*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and

of which I do not exactly comprehend, not belonging to their *person_mentioned*cabinet*/person_mentioned*.
I have not been honoured with a sight of their embassage nor 
credentials but I expect they will stop at *location_mentioned*san Filipe */location_mentioned*and perhaps exhibit
their documents to you. The request I now have to make is this
that should this important personage honour you with a call, that
you receive him with just such marks of distinction as his 
occupation his station in life and the importance, or non importance of his<barker_pb n="175"/>

great favour which the *person_mentioned*Mexican government */person_mentioned*has though[t] fit to
bestow upon us in granting us land to be caried into effect without
being contaminated with foul hands, I should not have said any
thing on this subject had it not been for the great industry, intreague
and management with which some petitions of sale has I am 
informed, have been goten up and Subscribers obtained*/p*
