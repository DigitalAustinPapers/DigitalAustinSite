*p*Dr Sir,*/p*

*p*My case has been travelling about from one *person_mentioned*tribunal */person_mentioned*to another
up to the present time at first a *person_mentioned*military tribunal*/person_mentioned*, then a juez de
letras, then to a *person_mentioned*district judge*/person_mentioned*—thence to the *person_mentioned*Supreme Court*/person_mentioned*. All
the *person_mentioned*inferior courts*/person_mentioned* decided that they had no jurisdiction over it,
and it was sent to the *person_mentioned*Supreme Court*/person_mentioned* for the purpose of ascertaining
what *person_mentioned*tribunal */person_mentioned*ought to try it. I have [now] been informed that
the *person_mentioned*Supreme Court*/person_mentioned* has decided that it must be tryed by the *person_mentioned*district
judge of the *location_mentioned*Federal district*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, so that I presume I shall now get on a
little faster. I have in eight months ascertained what court is to
try the matter.*/p*

*p*I am of the opinion that my affairs will terminate favourably, and
without much more delay. I think I shall be able to get my liberty
by giving bail or [security] not to leave this city.*/p*

*p*I wrote to my brother in law *person_mentioned*James F. Perry*/person_mentioned* [on the]*date_mentioned n="08-25-1834"> 25 of last
month.*/date_mentioned* I refer you and my friends to that letter. I have nothing
more to add to it, except to repeat the opinion that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*ought to
keep out [of] all kind of political excitements, and act in strict
conformity with the motto—<hi rend="italic">Fidelity to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and opposition to
violent men or measures</hi>. Also all kind of personalities, ought to be
forgotten and buried. I have been more [injured] by them, than
any other, and I will be the first to forget them and meet my
*person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*in harmony on the basis of the motto above stated.*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="09-06-1834">Yesterday */date_mentioned*I recd your letter dated *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="07-31-1834">31 July*/date_mentioned*. I
expect I shall have to draw on *person_mentioned*Beers St John and Co*/person_mentioned* for another
thousand dollars, to pay *person_mentioned*lawyer*/person_mentioned*s fees etc, you write me in the above
letter that I can draw on them. I sent *person_mentioned*Perry */person_mentioned*a power of attorney
to sell any of my property he thought proper, and I rely on you
and him to save my property from the wreck that seems to have
been intended by some persons, for me.*/p*

*p*I approve of your determination to devote yourself to commerce.
Your *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*in the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned* are well known and
have a standing in the com[mercial] world, that enables them to
afford you great facilities and advantages as a *person_mentioned*merchant*/person_mentioned*, and besides
this, in that business you can reasonably expect some tranquility
and happi[ness] which you, nor no other man, need ever look for
in public affairs [or] politics. Let them alone for the rest of your
life if you wish for peace and [pros]perity.*/p*

*p*Send this to *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned*. I am in tolerable health, but have
suffered a good deal from rheumatism. The State Govt, have
[been] imposed upon and deceived. My *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*might
undeceive them if they were disposed to do so.   But "out of<barker_pb n="1088"/>
sight out of mind " perhaps applies to me. I know not whether
I have friends there out of my own family. It is reported in
this city that I have none and as a proof of it, it is said that a 
*location_mentioned*newspaper */location_mentioned*is bountifully supported in the colony by the great mass of Ihe
people for the express purpose of abusing me. This I do not
believe nor half of the reports about the efforts of individuals to
calumniate and ruin me. I cannot, as yet, have so bad an opinion
of human nature. I care nothing about the *location_mentioned*upper colony*/location_mentioned* except
to show that all my conduct in regard to it has been correct, as
it has been. I certainly do rely upon my *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*in the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*
to make some efforts to place the truth of all these matters before
the Govt. They ought to remember that I am in a distant *location_mentioned*prison*/location_mentioned*
unable, [by my] situation, to repel calumny, or defend [my] self—
and that I am in this prison for having performed what I believed
was my duty to my constituents; as a public *person_mentioned*agent*/person_mentioned*. It ought to be
remembered that the duties of *person_mentioned*constituents*/person_mentioned*, towards their *person_mentioned*public
agents*/person_mentioned*, is not less sacred and [man]datory, than that of the *person_mentioned*agent*/person_mentioned*
to his *person_mentioned*constituents*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I think you ought to go to *location_mentioned*Menclova*/location_mentioned*, [and] lay a statement of
facts before the *person_mentioned*state [govern]ment*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*[Re]member me to *person_mentioned*Sarah*/person_mentioned*, to *person_mentioned*Mr Scotts[fam]ily*/person_mentioned* , and to all my
old *person_mentioned*companions */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p*[A letter dated] *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="05-04-1834">May 4*/date_mentioned* was published in the *location_mentioned*New Orleans
Bulletin*/location_mentioned* which has in[jured me]. I prefer that my name should
be [kept] out of the *location_mentioned*news papers*/location_mentioned*. All is perfectly quiet *location_mentioned*in this
quarter */location_mentioned*and I believe *location_mentioned*all over the nation*/location_mentioned*. The elections are going
on in harmony every where.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I send this by *person_mentioned*Mr Comber*/person_mentioned*, a respectable young gentleman of some
capital, who thinks of settling somewhere in that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, I 
recommend him to all my *person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned**/p*
