*div1 type="body"*

*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin,*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="01-03-1830">Jany 3, 1830*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr brother and Sister*/p*

*p*Altho, I have written three letters to you within the last two
weeks on the subject of your removal to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, I again repeat
the same advise contained in my other letters, least they may have
miscarried.*person_mentioned* Dr. Hutchison*/person_mentioned* of the*location_mentioned* Boons Lick country*/location_mentioned* takes on
this. He will remove, and perhaps *person_mentioned*Genl T. A. Smith */person_mentioned*(a *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned*
of *person_mentioned*Jack*/person_mentioned*'s, tho quite a different man) will also remove in the *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1830">fall*/date_mentioned*.
When such men as *person_mentioned*Genl Smith*/person_mentioned* begin to turn their attention this
way, you may be sure the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*must rise. I have lately made an
arrangement for a large emigration of *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*of the first respectability
from *location_mentioned*North Alabama */location_mentioned*round *location_mentioned*Tuscumbia*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*Huntsville */location_mentioned*etc they are all
*person_mentioned*men of wealth.*/person_mentioned* Within the last two months one hundred and fifty
three *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*have arrived and they are generally of the better
class and *person_mentioned*men of property*/person_mentioned*. In a year more this *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*will be filled
up, <hi rend="italic">now then is the time</hi>, if you remove soon you must make a 
fortune. The land I have asked for, for you and *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*I have no doubt
will be granted—that is *person_mentioned*Eleven Leagues*/person_mentioned* but the title will be void 
unless you remove. I have asked two years for you to remove in, but
am of opinion that only one year will be granted. I can do 
something for you now but after my colonizing business is done, the door
will be closed in comparison to what it is now.*/p*

*p*The whole expenses of a *location_mentioned*League */location_mentioned*to a *person_mentioned*settler */person_mentioned*is about $150, and
there is 4, 5, and 6 years to pay a part of that. Many of the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*
are poor and will give one half to any one who clears out and pays
the expenses on the *location_mentioned*whole League*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*In *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1830">November next*/date_mentioned* the *location_mentioned*custom house*/location_mentioned* will be established and duties
collected, for the law which exempted *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*from all duties for
seven years will expire in *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1830">November*/date_mentioned*, so that you ought to be here
with an assortment of goods before *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1830">November*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*cannot be introduced as *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*, but as *person_mentioned*indented */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*hired
servants*/person_mentioned*. I shall start in about *date_mentioned n="01-13-1830">ten days*/date_mentioned* to survey the *location_mentioned*land I have
petitioned for*/location_mentioned*, for you, and select a *location_mentioned*building place*/location_mentioned*, and then write
more particularly. If you will send on a trusty *person_mentioned*man */person_mentioned*with two or
three *person_mentioned*hands */person_mentioned*to build some *location_mentioned*cabins */location_mentioned*it would not be amiss to do so.
Stock cattle can be got for goods and if you can bring on a good
*person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*to put on your land and tend stock you might soon have a
1000 head. Beeves may be shipped *location_mentioned*from the spot to Orleans */location_mentioned*not
more than four days run—in fact to include all in a few words
<hi rend="italic">you must remove and that immediately</hi>.*/p*

*p*My constitution is failing rapidly, and I want you here, to see
my *person_mentioned*sisters children*/person_mentioned* all provided for before I die*/p*.

*p*Bring all kinds and barrels of fruit seed of the best kind.*/p*<barker_pb n="318"/>

*p*In dry weather there is a very good *location_mentioned*wagon or carriage road*/location_mentioned* *location_mentioned*from
Alexandria to this place*/location_mentioned*. You can take choice of roads either to
send everything by water, and bring the *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*out in a carriage
from *location_mentioned*Alexandria*/location_mentioned*, or embark the *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*and come by
water. The *location_mentioned*road */location_mentioned*is a very good one and much used and it is settled
and safe, the *location_mentioned*settlements */location_mentioned*tho are thin. You must bring bedding
and furniture. I have nothing of that kind and want some for
myself.*/p*

*p*Send your articles or goods to *person_mentioned*James W. Breedlove*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*New Orleans
*/location_mentioned*with instructions to ship them to *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*Brazoria Texas.*/location_mentioned*
Also send your letters <hi rend="italic">postpaid </hi>by the same channel. Close your
affairs in that *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and push on as fast as possible. I have
applied for a grant for *person_mentioned*Henry Austin*/person_mentioned* who is now running a steam
boat on *location_mentioned*Rio Grande.*/location_mentioned* If you come by land bring a decent carriage,
you will need it here, and if not, it can be sold. We are beginning
to get <hi rend="italic">up </hi>in this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and decent and fine clothes have taken
the place of buckskin.*/p*

*p*Present my respects to my old friend *person_mentioned*Saml Perry*/person_mentioned* and tell him my
advise is to quit that cold region and emigrate to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. With
his capital he might make a princely fortune here.*/p*

*p*Do the same to my old friend *person_mentioned*John Perry*/person_mentioned* and to his lively and
agreeable *person_mentioned*Lady*/person_mentioned*. Why not all come? They can command my
friendship, and I can do something for them if they come quickly.*/p*

*p*What are *person_mentioned*Elias Bates*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Honey */person_mentioned*doing? Also *person_mentioned*James Austin's
children.*/person_mentioned* I would get them *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*if they would come but I shall not
write to them anymore for I wished them all to move years ago,
and they [have] not even answered my letters. Bring *person_mentioned*Adeline*/person_mentioned*.
She can get a league of land and a *person_mentioned*husband */person_mentioned*afterwards.*/p*
