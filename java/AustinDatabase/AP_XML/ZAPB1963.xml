<p>Austin to James F. Perry June 16, 1830. Instructions for shipping goods to Texas. Rumors in Mexico that United States will take Texas by force of arms.   Anxious to close his public business and rest.</p>

<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I returned from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>in much better health than when you left
here— There appears to be some clouds hanging over this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>,
tho I apprehend nothing from them, and my opinion as to your
removal here is the same as when you left. If you come by land
write to <person_mentioned>Breedlove </person_mentioned>for a passport and state the number of your
<person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>. The law requires all persons to bring passports and it
should be done because it is the law.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>custom house officer of <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has fixed his office for the
present <location_mentioned>at the mouth of the Brasos river—</location_mentioned>vessels must be cleared<barker_pb n="420"/>
out for <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned>, and if you send a vessel from <location_mentioned>Philadelphia </location_mentioned>clear
out for <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>and not for the <location_mentioned>Brasos </location_mentioned>but come to the <location_mentioned>B</location_mentioned>. if you
wish from <location_mentioned>Phia </location_mentioned>you can get debenture allowed, but in <location_mentioned>new Orleans
</location_mentioned>you cannot</p>

<p>They have some very erroneous ideas in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>relative to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
but I think that a few months will convince them of their error—
The last dates from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>says that the <location_mentioned>united States of the north
</location_mentioned>are about to send a large <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>to take this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>by force etc,
etc. how they should entertain an idea that the <location_mentioned>U S.</location_mentioned> is unfriendly
I can not conceive—</p>

<p>All kinds of provisions and lumber are free and no duties will
be collected untill after <date_mentioned n="12-xx-1830">November </date_mentioned>as I informed you when here—</p>

<p>Poor <person_mentioned>James </person_mentioned>died before I returned from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>and I did not
see him—</p>

<p>I am making final arrangements to close all my business this <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1830">fall</date_mentioned>
and <date_mentioned n="Winter - 1830">winter</date_mentioned>, and prepare myself to spend my time in a retired and
quiet manner with you—</p>

<p>I was very well received at <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>and all things stand well with
the <person_mentioned>State authorities</person_mentioned>— They wish me in <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>to go to the
<location_mentioned>Legislature </location_mentioned>but I have refused— The fact is that unless I can take
some rest I shall not live much longer for I am nearly worn down—
for nine years since I came to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, my mind has had no rest,
nothing to releave it from continued cares and anxieties— I have
felt towards all the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>as tho. they were all my <person_mentioned>relations</person_mentioned>,
Some of them have not merited the anxiety I have suffered for
them I have been a faithful servant of this Govt, and have 
performed much important service for it— wheither I shall receive
thanks, or abuse, is doubtful, <person_mentioned>Poinsett </person_mentioned>has left an impression in
<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>which has reduced the <person_mentioned>North American </person_mentioned>character to a low
grade there.— I do not pretend to say that he has done right, or
wrong, for I know nothing about his conduct-— he has certainly
been the most unfortunate <person_mentioned>minister </person_mentioned>that was ever sent to any Govt.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen Teran </person_mentioned>has not yet left <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>and the news of the
<person_mentioned>Spanish </person_mentioned>invasion will probably prevent his coming on.</p>

<p>Every thing is peace and quietness in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and so likely to
remain.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col Milam</person_mentioned> says that the <location_mentioned>roads </location_mentioned>are good for a carriage all the
way to <location_mentioned>Nachitochs </location_mentioned>and he advises you to remove by that route—
it will be a very long and tedious journey, but you and <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>must
decide, inform me which route you will take so that I may provide
the nessery matters for you—- I have an idea of puting up a
<location_mentioned>House </location_mentioned>in this place which will do for you to winter in— The
<location_mentioned>Steam Saw mill</location_mentioned> is in operation and works well</p><barker_pb n="421"/>

<p>A new <person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>will be on shortly and I shall soon complete
all the titles— Did you call on the <person_mentioned>Comte at <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>and how
did he treat you. Inform me wheither you intend sending out goods
from <location_mentioned>Pa</location_mentioned>. it will be best to land them in the <location_mentioned>Brasos</location_mentioned>, I think, tho if
the vessel is large she must come into <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>I expect your best
plan will be to ship them to <location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>and thence to this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.
I will write by every opportunity, both to <location_mentioned>Potosi </location_mentioned>and to 
<location_mentioned>Philadelphia </location_mentioned>to the care of <person_mentioned>Price and Morgan</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Tell all the <person_mentioned>emigrants </person_mentioned>to call on <person_mentioned>Breedlove </person_mentioned>for a passport, because
the law makes it necessary—</p>

<p>remember me to the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>, I have received several letters from
you of old date since you left and one from <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>. I saw <person_mentioned>Sam
Browne</person_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="06-15-1830">yesterday</date_mentioned>, he is in very good health, but I had not time
to Say more than how do you do, to him for it was mail day—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="06-16-1830">June 16 1830</date_mentioned></p>
