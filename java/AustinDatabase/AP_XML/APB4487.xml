*p**location_mentioned*District of Teneha, Texas*/location_mentioned*,*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="11-30-1832">November 30th 1832*/date_mentioned*.*/p*
*p*Dear Sir,*/p*

*p*Your letter of the *date_mentioned n="11-18-1832">18th*/date_mentioned*, current came [to] hand *date_mentioned n="11-29-1832">late last evening*/date_mentioned*.
The one you mention as giving an account of our "political 
situation," has not been received, nor any other except the one of the *date_mentioned n="11-18-1832">18th*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Rumor is busy with her thousand tongues, but we know nothing
of the interior, not even whether *person_mentioned*Mr. Wharton*/person_mentioned* is gone or not.*/p*

*p*Our military elections are in a very unpleasant situation, and the
*person_mentioned*sub committee of this *location_mentioned*district*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* have wrote to the *person_mentioned*Chairman of the
central committee*/person_mentioned* on the subject; but we are fearful that he has
not as yet received the letter.*/p*

*p*I am told that there is an opportunity of forwarding this letter
by a *person_mentioned*Mr Burk*/person_mentioned* provided it is *location_mentioned*at the Big Road */location_mentioned*by twelve of the
clock *date_mentioned n="11-30-1832">to-day*/date_mentioned*, but for this I should have taken your letter down and
conversed with some of the *person_mentioned*principal citizens in the *location_mentioned*Aysh District*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*
on the subject of it before I wrote you an answer. But as it is, I
will with pleasure give you my opinion fully and frankly "that I
think the *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*these three districts */location_mentioned*would gladly embrace
the project of uniting with the *person_mentioned*people of *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*the rest of
Texas*/location_mentioned* in forming a *person_mentioned*provisional government*/person_mentioned* on the basis that *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*
is a part of the *location_mentioned*Mexican confederation*/location_mentioned*, and will so remain and that
we are all *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned*and will rigidly procet [protect] all the rights
and interests of *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*. ["]*/p*

*p*The idea of a *person_mentioned*separate, distinct, and independent government*/person_mentioned* I
do not believe exists in the mind of *person_mentioned*any man of common sense in
the *location_mentioned*district*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*. Nor do they want to belong to the *location_mentioned*United States of
the North*/location_mentioned*, there are some fiew exceptions to this last opinion, but
not many, scarsely one to ten.*/p*

*p*They have come to the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*to participate of the benefits of
the *location_mentioned*Mexican Independence*/location_mentioned*, and of their liberal policy in regard to
land, and they wish to continue so. The idea of Texas being
independent and forming a nation is absurd. The very expenses of
supporting the Government could they have it, would render them
the most oppressed people. Besides their weakness would invite
aggression.*/p*

*p*They want a *person_mentioned*provisional Government*/person_mentioned*—they want a judiciary—
the present system is little or no protection to their *person_mentioned*persons or
property*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I will write you more at large on this subject, but at present am
in such fear of loosing the opportunity of conveyance, that I am
not able to write as I other wise would*/p*.<barker_pb n="896"/>

*p*I hope you will continue to write and give me an account of the
political complection of the *location_mentioned*interior*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Be pleased to direct your letter to me at *location_mentioned*Teneha */location_mentioned*to be left at
*location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Mr Philip */person_mentioned*Sublet's Big Road.   Ayish District*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Be so good as to present my respects to *person_mentioned*Mr. Williams*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*J. Harrison*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Colonel S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*
