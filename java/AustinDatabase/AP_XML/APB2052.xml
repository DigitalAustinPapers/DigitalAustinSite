*p**person_mentioned*Francis Keller, Esqr*/person_mentioned*.—*/p*

*p*Dear Sir: As you are about to visit the *location_mentioned*Colony of *person_mentioned*Colonel Austin*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned*,
I shall take it a particular favor if you will make enquiries 
respecting the prospects of establishing a printing Press in that place.
Should *person_mentioned*Col. Austin*/person_mentioned* be of opinion that a well conducted Journal
would aid his views and assist in peopling that interesting *location_mentioned*section
of country */location_mentioned*I can remove with an entire new establishment, which I
lately selected in *location_mentioned*Cincinnati*/location_mentioned*, and is at present here—The original
cost, with paper sufficient for one year, and all expences of 
transportation from this to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, will cost not quite $1000, or at most
would not exceed it.*/p*

*p*A paper established there at this period would more materially aid
the improvement of that *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*than any thing I know of.—Various
and erroneous opinions have gone abroad in *location_mentioned*Ohio */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Kentucky*/location_mentioned*, 
respecting the soil, climate, products, etc. and if a paper was printed
there it would receive a wide circulation in the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned*—In
*location_mentioned*Ohio*/location_mentioned*, several *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*would have moved over but for fear of the
truth of what they had heard against the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—I endeavored to
do away with those impressions and promised to write to them—they
are persons of easy circumstances, and respectable character, you can
acquaint *person_mentioned*Col. Austin*/person_mentioned* with my situation, etc., etc.*/p*

*p*Request him to write to me on the subject—*/p*
