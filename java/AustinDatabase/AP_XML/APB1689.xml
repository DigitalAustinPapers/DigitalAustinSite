*p*I shall be fully prepaired by the middle or *date_mentioned n="04-30-1829">last of next month*/date_mentioned* to
make a final settlement and division of the interest which our friend
*person_mentioned*Hawkins */person_mentioned*had in the land granted to me by the *person_mentioned*Mexican Govt*/person_mentioned*, for

*person_mentioned*Mr John Austin*/person_mentioned*, who will present this, whether you are fully
Authorised as the *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*of *person_mentioned*Hawkins */person_mentioned*Estate to close that business,
for in the event of your being thus authorised I will visit *location_mentioned*New
Orleans*/location_mentioned* the next trip of the Schooner Eclipse, which will be some

*p*The title to the *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*cannot be vested in an *person_mentioned*alien */person_mentioned*and must remain
in me or in some *person_mentioned*Mexican citizen*/person_mentioned*, but I deem it necessary that a

letters etc canceled and the business brought to a final close Should
you wish that the title should still continue in me, and that I should
take charge of the *location_mentioned*property */location_mentioned*and sell parts of it, or lease and settle
other parts etc, I will do so cheerfully and faithfully, but this should
be done under the authority of special instructions to that effect—¦
from the legal *person_mentioned*agent of the Estate*/person_mentioned* after the division is made and
*person_mentioned*Hawkins */person_mentioned*part designated*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mrs Hawkins*/person_mentioned* wrote to me to divide it myself and manage it as
I deemed best but I prefer laying the plats all before you, as the
