*p*My dear Sir,*/p*

*p*My health is so far restored that I am on my way to the *location_mentioned*mouth
of the River*/location_mentioned* for shells for my *location_mentioned*buildings */location_mentioned*and have hopes I have
conquered the desease— I have been extremely anxious about you
and [your] *person_mentioned*Sister's family*/person_mentioned*, the fever is so prevalent that 
travelling in such intense heat as we have had is extremly hazardous,
to *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*unacclimated and even to you who are so hardy— *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*
has brought on fever by riding *location_mentioned*in the sun */location_mentioned*but is nearly recovered—
It positively will not do for either myself or *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* to think of
keeping our *person_mentioned*familys */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*this part of the country*/location_mentioned* in the summer
months, the insects alone would drive them mad. They have 
operated upon me at *location_mentioned*Bolivar */location_mentioned*like a perpetual blister. I wish much
to accompany you to the *location_mentioned*upper country*/location_mentioned* when you go. I beg you
will advise me of your movements— at present I have five *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*
under pay till the *date_mentioned n="09-10-1831">10th proxo*/date_mentioned* and as nothing is done unless I am
present, I do not wish to leave until then, still should you go
sooner I would endeavour to join you.*/p*<barker_pb n="691"/>

*p*I had hopes you would have taken your *person_mentioned*Sisters family*/person_mentioned* to *location_mentioned*Coles
Settlement*/location_mentioned* until the heats were over, would it not be best for
them to go there now ?—*/p*

*p*Should you come to *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*do me the favor to let me know
when, if oppy offers for *location_mentioned*Boliva*/location_mentioned**/p*r

*p*I have a letter from *location_mentioned*Ware */location_mentioned*altho he had no accounts from me he
had contracted for Machinery with the intention of working it in
*location_mentioned*Louisiana */location_mentioned*in case my report should be unfavorable for *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, the
advise of the failure of a*location_mentioned* house in Orleans */location_mentioned*whose paper he held for
10600$ payable *date_mentioned n="06-01-1831">1 June*/date_mentioned* here caused him to suspend the contract
until he could ascertain the result of that and his other *location_mentioned*N Orleans
*/location_mentioned*papers this being part of the sum appropriated to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*
Speculations, his letter was obviously written at the moment of receiving
the unpleasant news, as he seems to consider all his *location_mentioned*Orleans paper
*/location_mentioned*in Jeopardy— so much for lending Money at 12 prct—the receipt
of my letters and ascertaining the actual extent of loss will probably
put him in better spirits*/p*

*p*My best regards to *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*and Compes to *person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned*—I will 
indeavour to visit *location_mentioned*St Felepe */location_mentioned*by the *date_mentioned n="09-15-1831">*location_mentioned*middle of Septr*/location_mentioned**/date_mentioned* at all events*/p*
