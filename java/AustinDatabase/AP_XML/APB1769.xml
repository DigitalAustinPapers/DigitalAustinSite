*p**person_mentioned*Col. Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Sir. I was much concerned in leaving your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*without seeing
you, and having farther conversation; I left it with a fixed 
determination of returning as soon as possible and my health was not
restored until the *date_mentioned n="07-xx-1829">July */date_mentioned*or *date_mentioned n="08-xx-1829">august */date_mentioned*thereafter,— I descended the *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*
*date_mentioned n="Winter - 1828">last winter*/date_mentioned* for the purpose, but hearing of the extreme indisposition
of my brother *person_mentioned*Maj. Carey Nicholas*/person_mentioned*, I was obliged to go to 
*location_mentioned*Tallahassee*/location_mentioned*, where I arrived in time to see him die, and was compelled
to administer upon his *person_mentioned*estate*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*In the mean time I have constituted myself a sort of *person_mentioned*recruiting
sergeant */person_mentioned*for your *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, I have said and done every thing in my
power to aid in its prosperity—it has now become a leading topic
in conversation, and one of the most interesting subjects of 
discussion in the *location_mentioned*political papers*/location_mentioned*.—*/p*

*p*A strong and simultaneous effort is at this moment making *location_mentioned*from
the one end of the country to the other*/location_mentioned*, to induce this *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*to 
purchase it— I incline to the belief, that if the*person_mentioned* Mexican Govt*/person_mentioned* will <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>
this *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*will <hi rend="italic">buy</hi>. I think that the prospects are so strong, as should
forbid a disposition to sell— The *location_mentioned*Sugar lands*/location_mentioned* on the *location_mentioned*Mississippi*/location_mentioned*
are selling for <hi rend="italic">seventy </hi>dollars the superficial acre—let the change
take place what will they be worth on the *location_mentioned*Brassos*/location_mentioned*?—*/p*

*p*Under all and every circumstance it is my fixed purpose to make
it my *location_mentioned*future residence*/location_mentioned*, and I doubt not that one or two years 
experience will enable me to induce the greater portion of my *person_mentioned**location_mentioned*Kentucky*/location_mentioned*
relatives */person_mentioned*to do the same.— Their doubts as to the health, the 
difficulty that presents itself to them as to <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>, the abandonment of
their *location_mentioned*native Country*/location_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*government*/person_mentioned*, are the stumbling blocks of
the present hour, Could these be removed the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*would be
filled immediately,—the unproductiveness of the Capital heretofore
engaged in the culture of Cotton, would fly there in Crowds beyond
your most sanguine hopes and calculations, I expect to be with
you the latter end of *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1829">November */date_mentioned*or first of *date_mentioned n="12-01-1829">December*/date_mentioned*— I will come
in the double character of *person_mentioned*Uncle */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*guardian to the Hawkinses*/person_mentioned*-—
and will be ready to take Such steps as you may suggest for the
division of the *location_mentioned*property*/location_mentioned*,   I shall come prepared to sit down upon *location_mentioned*one<barker_pb n="264"/>
of the Leagues on the Oyster Bayou*/location_mentioned*,— My wish is to get the one
*location_mentioned*nearest the Sea beach*/location_mentioned*— Should it be more valuable than any of
the others, I will be willing to pay the difference—that difference
being estimated by the intelligent and disinterested. As I shall come
prepared with men, tools provisions, seeds, and every description of
thing that the new *person_mentioned*settler */person_mentioned*would require—*/p*

*p*The prime object of this letter is to induce you to point out and
designate the *location_mentioned*league */location_mentioned*that you may be willing or wish me to settle
on. For instance, I wish you to procure some *person_mentioned*surveyors*/person_mentioned*, to go on
the ground, and remark and designate the league—leaving the 
istructions at *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Mitchell*/person_mentioned*s*/location_mentioned*, or should there be no *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*at 
*location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Mitchell*/person_mentioned*'s former residence*/location_mentioned*, at *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Clark*/person_mentioned*s*/location_mentioned* or some intermediate place, where
I may be sure to fall in with them, and thus save the time and trouble
of calling at your *location_mentioned*residence */location_mentioned*to obtain the information— If there
is no insurmountable objection to getting the *location_mentioned*league next the ocean*/location_mentioned*,
I rely most confidently on your acquiesance,*/p*

*p*I shall come prepared to become a loyal useful *person_mentioned*citizen*/person_mentioned*—it is my
expectation and intention to be able to put up immediately a small
*location_mentioned*steam Saw mill*/location_mentioned*, and to build immedeately a schooner for the 
*location_mentioned*Coasting*/location_mentioned* trade—tho' so long neglected, I feel confident this is the most
valuable part of your *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*— with moderate luck, I think I shall
be able to exemplify this beyond a doubt, and in consequence, 
enhance the value of the lands-— I shall bring with me some choice
seed wheat, I wish you to select some *person_mentioned*planter */person_mentioned*to whom I will give it,
and thus have at once a satisfactory experiment made upon this
valuable grain.*/p*
