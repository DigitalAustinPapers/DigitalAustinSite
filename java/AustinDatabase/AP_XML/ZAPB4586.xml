<p>I refer you to my letter to the <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>for news as to my 
mission, and will only state I have very strong and well founded hopes
of complete success—I believe that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will be a <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>in a short
time with the approbation of the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. But if our application is
refused I shall be in favor of organising without it I see no other
way of saving that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>from total anarchy and ruin—I am
totally done with concilliatory measures, and for the future shall be
uncompromising as [to] Texas matters.</p><barker_pb n="992"/>

<p>Why do you not write me? I expected to hare recd, letters here—
none from anyone—-! am uneasy very much so indeed—I heard a
bad account about overflow and cholera but hope it is incorrect—
I had a wretched trip. <hi rend="italic">One month</hi> from <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> in
a little schooner—ten days on short allowance of water—none but
salt provisions—and sea sick all the time. But I am well now.
<person_mentioned>Padre Muldoon</person_mentioned> sends his respects to every one—he does all he can
for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p>Love to the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>and your <person_mentioned>neighbors</person_mentioned>.</p>
