and anxious to join us in the War as soon as their crops are laid by
and the <location_mentioned>rivers</location_mentioned> fall which at this time are very high—<person_mentioned>Foster </person_mentioned>also
says that he met with an old <person_mentioned>Apadachy Chief</person_mentioned> of the <person_mentioned>liaches </person_mentioned>who he
had seen before and Knew, this <person_mentioned>chief </person_mentioned>told him that the <person_mentioned>Wacos</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Tahuacanies </person_mentioned>had called a great Council of the <person_mentioned>Comanches </person_mentioned>and
all the small <person_mentioned>tribes </person_mentioned><location_mentioned>beyond the Trinity river above the road </location_mentioned>except
the <person_mentioned>Cherokees</person_mentioned>, that this <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>was to meet Soon and the objects of
it was to unite all those <person_mentioned>tribes </person_mentioned>to distroy the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>on the

have satisfaction at the <location_mentioned>Trinity </location_mentioned>he was told by <person_mentioned>Mrs. Trammel</person_mentioned> that
5 <person_mentioned>Keechis </person_mentioned>had been there the day before and that they told a <person_mentioned>Spaniard</person_mentioned>
that they intended to kill all the <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>. She took an old <person_mentioned>Aynye

with propriety order out 200 <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>under the command of an <person_mentioned>officer</person_mentioned>
appointed for that purpose to cut off the 200 Who I am informed are
imbodied and who it is probable will endeavor to join the <person_mentioned>Wacos</person_mentioned>—
