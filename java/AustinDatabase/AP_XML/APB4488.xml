*p*Most Esteemed Friend.*/p*

*p*I left *location_mentioned*Austin */location_mentioned*on a visit to your *location_mentioned*City*/location_mentioned*, arrived here *date_mentioned n="11-29-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*and
continue on my way *date_mentioned n="12-01-1832">tomorrow*/date_mentioned*. The *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento of *location_mentioned*Austin*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* held
no meeting owing to the sickness of its *person_mentioned*members*/person_mentioned*, since the *person_mentioned*Alcalde*/person_mentioned*
received the communication about the convention and *person_mentioned*committees*/person_mentioned*:
for this reason they have not answered it, I believe that their answer
may be delayed somewhat: In the mean time, I see no difficulty
in placing the affairs on a footing, that would secure union and
harmony throughout *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. It seems that there is at *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*a 
uniform agreement on the <hi rend="italic">substance </hi>of the representation, only some
disagreement on the <hi rend="italic">manner </hi>of representing. If it is so, it will be
easy to settle the difficulty: let *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*take the lead in the matter.
In short, the main object of my visit is. to see if there is any means
to avoid a dissentment with *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*, and the balance of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. This
journey is rather troublesome to me, owing as well to the bad 
condition of the *location_mentioned*roads*/location_mentioned*, as to the danger of *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*, and the loss of
time from my private business, but we wish to see harmony prevail
in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, as it exists already in substance. The forms are of little
importance, and ought not to breed discord, though I believe it
will not be difficult to satisfy all parties, and to obtain a unity of
action.   I shall be with you, a few hours after these lines reach you.*/p*
