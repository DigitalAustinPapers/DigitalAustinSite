*p*[From Bexar Archives]*/p*

*p*Dear Sir I feel it my duty to inform you that there is and has
lately been a very considerable quantity of contraband passed on in
the Direction of *location_mentioned*Bejar */location_mentioned*and I beleave both *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Americans*/person_mentioned*
are ingaged in that traffic— There are two *location_mentioned*roads */location_mentioned*formed within a
few months which cross the *location_mentioned*Guadaluop */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*below this place one about a
league, and the other about three leagues below this Town*/location_mentioned*— I have
no *person_mentioned*troops */person_mentioned*at my command—and therefore it is out of my power to
detect it without it should come through this *location_mentioned*town */location_mentioned*which they
always avoid— This contraband is not owned by *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*under my
Jurisdiction; neither do they wish it to pass through this 
*location_mentioned*neighborhood*/location_mentioned*, least they should be blamed for incouraging it; And you well
remember the censure which has been thrown on me at the *location_mentioned*Labaca*/location_mentioned*
on account of contraband of which I never took any part— And
now again passing so near me compells me to give you this 
information; and hope there may be mean[s] taken to prevent its coming
through our *location_mentioned*vicinity*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*The threats of the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*I fear will greatly retard the settling
of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*; but should a Campaign be sent against them in a
properly manner I think there can be an end put to them at once.*/p*

*p*Could a few *person_mentioned*troops */person_mentioned*be furnished us at this time, it would greatly
add to the settling of the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, and there by strengthen the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I would be truly happy to recieve a line from you respecting the
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*and the probability of our geting some *person_mentioned*troops */person_mentioned*at this place
etc.*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="05-03-1829">Five days ago */date_mentioned*another *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*arrived here from *location_mentioned*Missouri*/location_mentioned*; consist
of a *person_mentioned*man */person_mentioned*and his *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and seven *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*. "We have now in the
