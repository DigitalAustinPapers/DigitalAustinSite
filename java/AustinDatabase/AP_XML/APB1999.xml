*p*Sir*/p*

*p*In the year *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1829">1829 */date_mentioned*towards the latter end I wrote a *location_mentioned*Pamphlet */location_mentioned*on
the subject of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, shewing the propriety and the necessity of
annexing that *location_mentioned*Province */location_mentioned*to the*location_mentioned* United States*/location_mentioned*, a copy of which I
forwarded to you by*person_mentioned* Captain Thompson */person_mentioned*late of the *person_mentioned*Mexican Navy*/person_mentioned*,
which I hope came safely to hand—- Never having had the 
opportunity of travelling in that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, I wrote from data collected<barker_pb n="459"/>
from a variety of persons *person_mentioned*strangers*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*acquaintances*/person_mentioned*, who had
visited the*location_mentioned* Province of Texas*/location_mentioned*, and more particularly your *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*.
It is not improbable that [in] a hasty publication embracing points
of general policy some of the Ideas thrown on paper and statements
with regard to it were incorrect: In speaking of the characters and
descriptions of *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*who have located and settled themselves
within the *location_mentioned*Province of Texas*/location_mentioned*, if my information had been as minute
as subsequent opportunities had afforded means of Judging, I should
have made a marked discrimination in favor of those people who
have located and settled themselves in *location_mentioned*St Philipe De Austin*/location_mentioned*— Upon
further investigation and enquiring into the plan of your *location_mentioned*settlement
on the Rio Brassos*/location_mentioned*, I was much gratified to learn, that you had
wisely taken a stand in favor of moral rectitude, deeming those the
best *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*who had the highest pretensions to character on that
score—and that in all instances where persons of suspicious 
character presented themselves for the facilities and liberal patronage
which you extend to *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*, you instituted the most rigid inquiries
and scrutiny into their private character. In every instance where
it was discovered the *person_mentioned*applicant */person_mentioned*had taken refuge in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, to escape
the Just punishment of crime committed within the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned*
whose laws he had violated. That such persons have never met
your countenance, and have been prohibited a domicile*location_mentioned* in the 
boundaries your Territories */location_mentioned*circumscribe. Being very lately impressed
with this Idea connected with the favorable light with which
I look upon the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, its capacities to give to enterprize new
and reiterated energies, by offering to the early *person_mentioned*settler*/person_mentioned*, a reasonable
prospect of gain where disease is rare, and the soil exuberant (a
location at once commercial and agricultural.) With these strongly
impressed considerations I have come to the determination of 
locating my*person_mentioned* eldest Son */person_mentioned**person_mentioned*Lewis */person_mentioned*some where in the *location_mentioned*province*/location_mentioned*, and altogether
more than probable within your *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*— To facilitate this enquiry
you will please address a letter to me as soon as circumstances will
permit, stating your terms to actual *person_mentioned*Settlers*/person_mentioned*— The price of your
*location_mentioned*first rate Sugar Lands*/location_mentioned*, in relation to all governing circumstances,
the proximity of Navigation direct, or as the case may be more 
remote from Navigation. And as a preliminary of great consequence
to me, what term of credit if any is allowed ?*/p*

*p*The object of my *person_mentioned*Son */person_mentioned*is to take up at least the quantity of Ten
thousand Acres, and unless facilities are given to [make] payments
he may not be able to bring round his engagements with punctuality.
My *person_mentioned*Son */person_mentioned*contemplates writing you on the subject whose letter will
reach you not long after this. I am informed that a *location_mentioned*Newspaper*/location_mentioned*
is published weekly at *location_mentioned*St Philipe De Austin */location_mentioned*  if it would be com-<barker_pb n="460"/>
patible with your convenience and not impose upon your politeness
too much trouble I should be much pleased to receive one or two
numbers of so interesting a Journal—*/p*
