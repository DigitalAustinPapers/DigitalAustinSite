<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>My dear Sir—I have just received your favour of <date_mentioned n="01-28-1832">28 ulto</date_mentioned>: by <person_mentioned>Mr,
Jaques</person_mentioned> and hasten to reply to— <person_mentioned>Mr. Lesassier </person_mentioned>writes me he has not
been able to make collections, but assigns no other reason than the
indisposition of<person_mentioned> Mr. Johnson.</person_mentioned> It is to me a most unpleasant thing
to write you on a subject in which you have no interest, as it has
the appearance of importunity; but could you feel the inconvenience
and unpleasant situation in which I am plared for the want of a few
hundred Dollars, you would I am convinced excuse it. Arriving
with a <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>in a new <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, you are aware that it is one 
continued expense, and without some means it is impossible to get along;
in my last settlement with our friend <person_mentioned>Lesassier</person_mentioned>, in consequence of
his being disappointed in some funds, I consented to his retaining
about $100 after he had collected it, with a full promise he would
amply supply me on my arrival in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. I mention this to
you in confidence; not to induce any unfavorable impression on your
mind toward <person_mentioned>Lesassier</person_mentioned>, but to show you I have been placed in my
present situation not from any neglect or want of foresight on my
part. I am sorry your arrangement for <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>has failed; and as I
have yet the privilege of locating one <location_mentioned>league</location_mentioned>, you would oblige me
by permitting the title to be made for <location_mentioned>the one adjoining mine on
Peyton's Creek</location_mentioned> originally taken by <person_mentioned>Col: Wallace.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Be good enough to inform me, if there bp any other court of
record in your jurisdiction, than that of <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>, also if I cannot
settle upon my <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>her furniture which belongs to her and a House
and lot I intend to erect, I want to secure to her at least a <location_mentioned>shelter</location_mentioned>,
and Household utensils. Also the mode of doing so. Your advice
upon these subjects will materially serve me. I send by <person_mentioned>Mr: Jaques
</person_mentioned>a letter, <location_mentioned>maps </location_mentioned>and a bundle of <location_mentioned>newspapers </location_mentioned>for you. In my last letter
I wrote for a power of attorney to vote on your <location_mentioned>Matagorda property</location_mentioned>
and now remention it, lest the other may not reach you. Nothing
but the utter impracticability of my leaving here prevents me seeing
you; but if it could by any possible means suit you to take <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>
in your way to <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>I need not say how much sincere pleasure it
would give me; for independent of my personal feelings I want to
know something of our political relations. Accept thanks of <person_mentioned>Mrs:
Fisher</person_mentioned> who I am pleased to say has recovered for your remembrances,
and accept of hers in return. She begs me to say she would be much
pleased to see a <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>of whom she has heard so much in her
<location_mentioned>little cabin</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. Rhoads Fisher<</person_mentioned>/p>

<p>Be pleased to tender my best regards to<person_mentioned> Mr: Williams and family.</person_mentioned></p>
