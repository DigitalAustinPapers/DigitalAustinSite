*p**person_mentioned*Col. S F Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*My dear Sir In a letter which I wrote you by *person_mentioned*Captn John
Austin*/person_mentioned* I expressed a wish that you might be induced to accept
*person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned*s invitation to meet him here rather than at *location_mentioned*La bahia
*/location_mentioned*or *location_mentioned*St Antonio*/location_mentioned*— Since writing circumstances have transpired
which cause me to suspect the *person_mentioned*Genl*/person_mentioned*s Views to be somewhat
treacherous*/p*

*p*When he came here one of his *person_mentioned*aids */person_mentioned*told *person_mentioned*Col Bradburn*/person_mentioned* who was
then with me that one of the*person_mentioned* Genl*/person_mentioned*s objects in visiting *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*was
to remove you from the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, your influence with the *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*
being dangerous to the security of the province—*/p*

*p*I paid but little attention to the observation at the time 
supposing it to be impossible for the *person_mentioned*Genl*/person_mentioned* to meditate so rash a
measure—*/p*

*p*Today there is great excitement amongst the *person_mentioned*Americans*/person_mentioned*, on acct
of a declaration *date_mentioned n="06-02-1830">last night*/date_mentioned* by the *person_mentioned*Genl */person_mentioned*to a *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*in presence
of an *person_mentioned*American */person_mentioned*whom he supposed not to understand *person_mentioned*Spanish*/person_mentioned*,
that he viewed the *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*in this part of the country */location_mentioned*as the
Most dangerous *person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*of it particularly the *person_mentioned*North Americans*/person_mentioned*
whose sole object was to wrest from the *person_mentioned*Mexicans */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*their property*/location_mentioned*
and so much of their *location_mentioned*territory */location_mentioned*as they could get— The *person_mentioned*American*/person_mentioned*
could not refrain from asking him if it were possible that such were
his real sentiments to which he replied they were— You know
the duplicity of the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*character—their general want of
faith in all transactions and the necessity of being guarded against
their villany— It is possible the observation of the*person_mentioned* Genls Aid to
Col B */person_mentioned*was with good information of the subject. It may therefore
be wise to keep yourself under cover of your own rifles, which
*person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned* has not nerve nor power to encounter you must take
good care not to let it transpire that I communicate with you on this
subject as it would probably consign me to the *location_mentioned*Calabose*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I shall be off as soon as I possibly can but have too much property
outstanding to do it immediately*/p*
