*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned*, *date_mentioned n="10-14-1830">Oct'r 14th 1830*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I find on examination of my letters which came in my absence
that things are quite at sixes and sevens both at *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*—
party spirit runs high and the former place is rather a hot bed
particularly for a *person_mentioned*member of the Legislature*/person_mentioned*. The *person_mentioned*Govr Viesca*/person_mentioned*
has offered his resignation ... I hear that *person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*is expected on
to *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*or *location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned* soon—*/p*                                                          

*p*Under the present prospect I think it quite doubtfull whether
anything can be done with the *location_mentioned*canal business*/location_mentioned*— I fear that nothing
can be obtained from the *person_mentioned*Legislature */person_mentioned*that will tend to promote the
prosperity of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*— Should we become a *location_mentioned*Territory */location_mentioned*perhaps some-
thing may be done towards raising funds for the *location_mentioned*Canal*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*One of the *person_mentioned*Texas member*/person_mentioned*s has been suspended, the other not but
so far as I can judge there is a very great excitement, and nothing
like union or harmony amongst the *person_mentioned*officers of Govt*/person_mentioned*., and the *person_mentioned*people
at *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* ...*/p*

*p*I shall never be content until I am clear of all kind of public
business and can concentrate all my affairs to my *location_mentioned*farm house*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*Farewell, I hope you may have a calm run to the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned*—it is
more than I expect to have for the next two years, and God knows
whether I shall ever see much quiet— our Govt affairs are so
continually in an uproar, and so very changeable that it will give
<hi rend="italic">me </hi>trouble placed as I am, tho' I think it will not materially retard
the advancement of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—*/p*
