*p*My dear *person_mentioned*Cousin*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*I am far from having forgotten you or your visit to *location_mentioned*Greenfield*/location_mentioned*,
as you suggest in your letter to my *person_mentioned*brother John*/person_mentioned*. Indeed, I often
find myself employed in tracing the progress of the " *person_mentioned*puny boy*/person_mentioned*,"
through the daring career of the*person_mentioned* enterprising man*/person_mentioned*. Little did either
of us, at that time, contemplate the condition in which the present
anniversary finds us. I have been more frequently led to these
reflections since I have been living comparatively near to you—since<barker_pb n="571"/>
I have been left alone to mark out the future destiny of myself and
my *person_mentioned*son*/person_mentioned*. More particularly with regard to my *person_mentioned*son */person_mentioned*I have thought
I would write to you and renew our acquaintance, in order to learn,
what prospect *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*would offer to him, looking some distance a
head: whether it would be an object for me to take any steps with
such views—securing land—etc. He is a boy of twelve, has talents
enough, but as yet I can not decide whether they will be marked
by the love of literature of his *person_mentioned*Father's family*/person_mentioned*, or the love of 
enterprise of mine. His education is before him, and occupies all my
cares. I have thought too, if my *person_mentioned*brothers */person_mentioned*could make it their
interest to remove to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, we could there together build up our
fallen *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*in new hopes and happiness. I am sure my *person_mentioned*brother
Henry's family*/person_mentioned* might be happier there <hi rend="italic">together </hi>than separated as
now. I am happily and usefully situated where I am but I am
<hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, and think—I am sure—I should prefer a place of tolerable
comfort, <hi rend="italic">entirely my own,—a permanent home</hi>, to all this luxury,
with dependence in the least possible sense. Do I deceive myself?
I saw your letters to my *person_mentioned*brothers*/person_mentioned*, and *location_mentioned*pamphlet */location_mentioned*while in*location_mentioned* New York*/location_mentioned*.
Are there persons among you who want education and 
accomplishments such as I could give if that would be necessary, after a year
or so? Be so good as to write me on these points, and others 
concerning your self.   Direct *location_mentioned*New Orleans, */location_mentioned*Care of *person_mentioned*Michael Fortier Esq*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have taken this moment to write from the possibility that my
*person_mentioned*brother Henry*/person_mentioned* may be with you, and he will thereby hear from me,
while a letter directed to him might benefit neither him nor yourself
if he should not be there.*/p*

*p*Is your *person_mentioned*Sister */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*her family */person_mentioned*with you.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mary Holley*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I lately heard from *location_mentioned*N York*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*New Haven*/location_mentioned* all well. I am
obliged to hurry to send my letter.*/p*

*p*[Addressed:] To,*person_mentioned* Col: S F Austin*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*St Filippe de Austin Texas
