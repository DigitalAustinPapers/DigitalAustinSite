<p><location_mentioned>Ayish Bayou District</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-05-1826"> Nov. 5. 1826</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Understanding that complaints have been made to yon by <person_mentioned>James
Gaines</person_mentioned>, respecting some of the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of your <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>, who he
has represented, have written letters to <person_mentioned>citizens </person_mentioned>of this <location_mentioned>District </location_mentioned>
calculated to excite dissaffection to the laws and the government, I
herein inclose the letters which gave rise to this complaint. They are
written you will see, by my old <person_mentioned>neighbors </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, Messrs 
<person_mentioned>Thompson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Payton</person_mentioned>, and not, as <person_mentioned>Capt. Gaines</person_mentioned> imagined by <person_mentioned>Mr White</person_mentioned></p>.

<p>The leters were brought to me from <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>Gaines</person_mentioned>, who,
when he delivered them, remarked that the handwriting was <person_mentioned>Squire
Whites</person_mentioned>', and desired me to permit him to read them. Finding that
they contained intelligence which I was requested to keep a secret,
and knowing <person_mentioned>Gaines </person_mentioned>of all men in the world to be the most unfit to be
trusted with one, I refused. Immediately his fruitful and 
disturbed imagination gave birth to the most dreadful suspicion and
he saw at once, in vision, the <location_mentioned>peaceful fields of the Ayish Bayou,
</location_mentioned>a prey to all the horrors of rebellion. Its indeed unfortunate that
we are debarred the privilege of friendly and confidential 
correspondence without incurring the imputation of treasonable designs.</p>

<p>I avail myself of the same opportunity to send you a copy of a
letter written by <person_mentioned>Capt. Gaines</person_mentioned> to the <person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>. It needs
no comment. You will see that he has proscribed some of the most
respectable <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of this <location_mentioned>District </location_mentioned>as well as yourself, and that
even an aged and defenceless <person_mentioned>female </person_mentioned>could not escape the poison of
his malice.</p>
