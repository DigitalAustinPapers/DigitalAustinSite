*p*Dr Sir.*/p*

*p*I have just arrived at this place, and as the mail is on the point
of leaving I drop you a line. I am comfortably lodged with *person_mentioned*Dn Juan
Francisco Lombaña*/person_mentioned* whom I think a very gentlemanly man.*/p*<barker_pb n="572"/>

*p*I shall detain here one day for the *person_mentioned*escort */person_mentioned*to get ready. The [re]
appears to be nothing new that I have heard of—tho have made no
inquiries.   *person_mentioned*Padre Musquis*/person_mentioned* has gone on.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*[George] Nixon*/person_mentioned* has expressed so much anxiety to be on good terms
again that I have agreed to it and wrote you by him stating that he
could [have] a League where it was entirely unappropriated— the
best conquest that can be made over an enemy is to convert him into
a friend. I told him that he could not get any *location_mentioned*forfeited League*/location_mentioned*.
On reflection as to the *location_mentioned*Lindsey League*/location_mentioned*—I think it had better be
held, for the present. After my arrival at *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*I think I can
get your petition granted, and if so you are more entitled to that
*location_mentioned*League */location_mentioned*than any one else, and you shall have my support to get it—
but keep this to yourself. Send instructions to *person_mentioned*S. P. Brown*/person_mentioned* how to
regulate his chain to the *location_mentioned*Mexican */location_mentioned*Measure. He sent me word by
*person_mentioned*Williamson */person_mentioned*that he had forgotten the difference between the *location_mentioned*Mexican*/location_mentioned*
and *location_mentioned*english */location_mentioned*measure.*/p*

*p*If *person_mentioned*young Tumlinson*/person_mentioned* applies for a place up *location_mentioned*on Navidad */location_mentioned*let him
have one—he is the best of that *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned**/p*
