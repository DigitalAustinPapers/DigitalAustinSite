*p*Austin to J. Mariano Guerra, Matamoros, July 10, 1882. Review of events in Texas to show that inhabitants are resisting unconstitutional measures. It is not to their interest and they do not want to secede from Mexico.*/p*
*/div1*

*div1 type="body"*

*p**person_mentioned*Colonel Mexia*/person_mentioned* delivered to me your communication of the 7th
inst, with a copy of the articles of agreement entered into between
yourself and that *person_mentioned*Officer*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*You request me "to acquaint *person_mentioned*Colonel Mexia*/person_mentioned* with the actual state
of the insurrection in the *location_mentioned*colonies*/location_mentioned*, and to consult with him as to
the means of restoreing peace and public order in view of the 
preservation of the integrity of the *location_mentioned*Mexican Territory*/location_mentioned*—the most 
important subject that can claim our attention under the Circumstances"*/p*

*p*I must in the first place say to you that I am a*person_mentioned* Mexican Citizen
*/person_mentioned*and will with the most scrupulous fidelity, comply with my duty as
such and as*person_mentioned* Colonel of the Battalion of Civil Militia of the 
Department of *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and if it becomes necessary will cheerfully sacrifice
my life in defence of the constitution and rights of the State and
*location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*, to which I have the honor of belonging. *person_mentioned*Señor Mexia*/person_mentioned* has
officially invited me to accompany him. In compliance to the 
communication of *person_mentioned*His late Excellency the Commanding General, Don
Manuel de Mier y Teran */person_mentioned*bearing date *date_mentioned n="06-25-1832">25 the ult*/date_mentioned*, your letter, and
*person_mentioned*Señor Mexia*/person_mentioned*'s invitation, I shall accompany that Gentleman to
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*although a sea voyage is very injurious to my health, owing
to sea sickness which acts severely on me.*/p*

*p*I beg to be allowed to correct a natural error, resulting from an
imperfect knowledge of the State of affairs in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and the 
honorable character of its *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*, There is no insurrection of the
*person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*against the Constitution and Government, neither do they
entertain ideas endangering even remotely the integrity of the 
*location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*. No portion of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*have committed any insults
against the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*flag, nor will they do so.*/p*<barker_pb n="816"/>

*p*It is necessary to take a retrospective view to understand the
cause of the evils that originated the disturbances at *location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned*.
The arrest of the *person_mentioned*Commissioner of the State of Coahuila and Texas,
Don Francisco Madero*/person_mentioned* by *person_mentioned*Colonel Davis Bradburn, Commander of
*location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*— The suspension by military orders of the 
*person_mentioned*Constitutional Ayuntamiento of Liberty*/person_mentioned*—the creation of the 
*person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento of Anahuac*/person_mentioned* by the same power without the authorization or
knowledge of the only Government lawfully competent to do so,
The *location_mentioned*State of Coahuila and Texas*/location_mentioned*. The arbitrary arrest and 
expulsion of several*person_mentioned* honorable citizens*/person_mentioned*, by*person_mentioned* Colonel Davis Bradburn*/person_mentioned*—-
The arbitrary intervention of that *person_mentioned*Officer */person_mentioned*in preventing an 
organization of a company of militia by the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento of Anahuac*/person_mentioned*, and
the arrest of said *person_mentioned*Officers */person_mentioned*of said company and finally numberless
acts of despotism perpetrated by that *person_mentioned*military Commander*/person_mentioned* have
caused the *person_mentioned*people on the *location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*to believe with reason that there
were no constitution, laws, or guaranty for the protection of person
or property in that section, save the law of might.*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*Government of the State*/person_mentioned* did not resist *person_mentioned*Colonel Bradburn*/person_mentioned*s
bold measures as it should have done, and therefore the unfortunate
*person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*sank into despair, and I suppose pronounced 
themselves in favor of *person_mentioned*Santa Ana*/person_mentioned* whose avowed object is the reign of
the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*and not that of whim and personal caprice. 
Consequently if there is an insurrection among the *person_mentioned*colonists */person_mentioned*it is for
supporting the constitution and the honor of the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*flag, and
not for attacking them.*/p*

*p*It has been said that the *person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*have insulted the *person_mentioned*Mexican*/person_mentioned*
flag; I dare answer that it is false; those who have trampled upon
the constitution, Laws, and guaranties under the authority of that
honored flag are the ones to bear the reproach of the insult, and not
the *person_mentioned*Mexican citizens*/person_mentioned* who resisted such abuses of power.*/p*

*p*All that has been said in regard to dangers for the integrity of
the *location_mentioned*Territory of Texas*/location_mentioned*, is a mere tale, which serves in ruining the
progress of that unhappy *location_mentioned*Territory*/location_mentioned*, by creating prejudice amongst
the *person_mentioned*Mexicans*/person_mentioned*, and disgust among the *person_mentioned*Colonists*/person_mentioned*, thus disturbing 
public peace.*/p*

*p*No man who is acquainted with *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will say or think that it ought
to secede from *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, supposing that it were in its power so to do
I am well aware as to what is the true interest of that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and
know the opinion of the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*and therefore I say, that were the
*person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*to declare that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*was fiee to secede or not. The
answer of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*would be, "Let the Constitution of the
*location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*be observed, and we will never consent to such a secession."*/p*

*p*I beg to insist on this point in order to enable you to make a 
distinction between a lawful opposition to infractions of the Constitu-<barker_pb n="817"/>
tion, and opposition to the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, dangerous to the integrity
of the *location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*. Then you will no longer entertain the doubts, and
erroneous ideas expressed in your above mentioned communication,
and the unjust and fatal habit of criminating the *person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*in 
general, as has been done heretofore will cease. In every population
there are idle *person_mentioned*talkers*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*drunkards*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*fools*/person_mentioned*: is it just or politic on
the part of the rulers to denounce the mass because there are some of
that kind ? Is it just or politic to irritate the wise portion of the 
*location_mentioned*community */location_mentioned*by insulting treatment, and to attribute to them criminal
ideas which they do not nor never did entertain,*/p*

*p*I proceed to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, not indeed, for preserving the integrity of the
*location_mentioned*territory */location_mentioned*which is not endangered, but to do every thing in
my power to calm the exasperation, which undoubtedly existed on
both sides, and that may lead to dangerous extremities, I wish to save
*person_mentioned*Davis Bradburn*/person_mentioned* if he has not already perished and I will also
interpose all my personal and official influence to uphold the dignity
and constitution of the *location_mentioned*State of Texas and Coahuila */location_mentioned*against the
attacks of the military power, and against whomsoever has insulted
it or should attempt to do so.*/p*

*p*On these terms I will act. I have expressed some time since, in
writing these sentiments to *person_mentioned*Colonel Ugartachea*/person_mentioned* and His *person_mentioned*Excellency
the Governor of the State*/person_mentioned*, and hope that a feeling of justice and a
desire to throw light on the subject will induce you to transmit a
copy of your letter to me, and of this answer to the *person_mentioned*Supreme Power
of the *location_mentioned*Nation */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* and of the *location_mentioned*State of Coahuila and Texas,*/location_mentioned* at the same
time that you will give your instructions in consequence to the
*person_mentioned*commander at Anahuac*/person_mentioned*. It is, then, understood that we will be
guided in our operations by the Constitution and lights of the
*location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*, and not by Martial Law that the irritation shall be calmed
and the past forgotten, without compelling the *person_mentioned*Inhabitants */person_mentioned*to make
public declarations in their defence or against any person. Finally
let the balsam of harmony be poured on all the wounds.*/p*

*p*God and Liberty.*/p*
