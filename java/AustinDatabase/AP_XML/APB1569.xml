*p*Dear Sir/.*/p*

*p*On my return from *location_mentioned*N Orleans */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="06-xx-1828">about 6 Weeks since*/date_mentioned*, I was put in
receipt of your letter stating a Law had passed, that *person_mentioned*servants */person_mentioned*could
be indented etc—*/p*

*p*The entelligence I immedeately made public, and am induced to 
believe the Law will be of great service to this *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*. It has made a
material change in the feelings of many valuable *person_mentioned*Emgrants */person_mentioned*and I
will have it published in *location_mentioned*N. Orleans*/location_mentioned*, that it may have publicity in
the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Amos Edwards*/person_mentioned* had Just arrived from *location_mentioned*Kentucky */location_mentioned*with several
*person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*, which would have required much management to secure, but
this Law at once places him at ease on that subject.*/p*

*p*Our *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*is not over active in promulgating the Laws—
therefore your Letter in this case was usefull— should anything occur
interesting to our section of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, you will confer a favr by
noting it, to some one residing at this place.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned* keeps himself much reserved and I believe his residence
with us will correct many evils that has much injured the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.
I have no doubt but the proceedings at this place on the part of the
*person_mentioned*alcalde */person_mentioned*has done more injury to the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*than any other cause.
Most of the *person_mentioned*Transcient persons*/person_mentioned* that visit here return disgusted*/p*

*p*My *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*is at this time totally ocupied by the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*. The
*person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Shaunesse */person_mentioned*are *person_mentioned*Agriculturists */person_mentioned*and do not live in 
*location_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*but in a compact *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*. They raise much corn, and I
have myself this season purchased from the *person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*alone5 not less
than 1000 Dollars worth of Corn and pease.*/p*<barker_pb n="75"/>

*p*My belive is, that it would improve there condition to Colonise
them— I will write to you frankly on this subject, in the course of a
short time*/p*
