<p>Dr Sir, If you will recollect when we were talking about the
division of the <location_mentioned>47th league of land</location_mentioned> granted to <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>and Myself;
You said that I was to have first choice <person_mentioned>Ingrim </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mr. S. Williams</person_mentioned>
were present and it was a fair and clear understanding between us
that I was to have the prefference; the <location_mentioned>lower half of said league</location_mentioned> is
my choice; but have understood that <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>has made a transfer of the
<location_mentioned>upper half</location_mentioned> to me: But when you call to recollection the conversation
that took place between us I am in hopes you will have the transfer
altered and let me have the <location_mentioned>lower half</location_mentioned> agreeable to the understanding
 that existed between us—The expences accruing in altering the<barker_pb n="1368"/>
transfer I will pay.—<person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>has repeatedly observed that he would
as soon have <location_mentioned>one half as the other </location_mentioned>and as I am willing to pay the
charge requisite in altering the transfer I hope it is a matter of
indifference with you</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Thomas Jamison</person_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>N. B</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>pleas inform me on the subject by <person_mentioned>Mr. Deckrow</person_mentioned> I have told you
as much about my making choice as ever I did <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>or any other
person, from the statement made to me by <person_mentioned>Selkirk </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>himself,
I expected I would take the <location_mentioned>upper half</location_mentioned> but upon taking a view of it
myself I prefer the <location_mentioned>lower half</location_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>still says it is a matter of
indifference with him. As for the improvement <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>claims I do not
consider he has a greater claim to the improvement than I have for
two thirds of the improvement was made by <person_mentioned>Morrison </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>McCoy</person_mentioned>
who asked my permission to plant corn on sd- Land—I have a Crop
now on the <location_mentioned>lower half</location_mentioned> and am building a House on same; which will
be completed in three or four days.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>nor no other person has ever called on me to make my choice</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Thomas Jamison</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col° S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>N. B. The above stated improvement made by <person_mentioned>Morrison McCoy
</person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>was made before the deed came out</p>

<p><person_mentioned>T. Jamison</person_mentioned></p>
