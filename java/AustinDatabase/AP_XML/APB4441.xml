*p**location_mentioned*Harrisburgh */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="10-03-1832">Octr. the 3rd 1832*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*From Various Circumstances, I have concluded to ask Your advice,
and opinion on some few subjects, and to be as concise as possible
I will remark, that this *person_mentioned*Jno. W. Moore*/person_mentioned* (who I believe is a Greater
Tyrant and less a respecter of the Constitution and Laws than *person_mentioned*Col
Bradborn*/person_mentioned*), has been persecuting and Slandering me, ever since a
short time after my Arrival at this *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*— I can trace to him the
Source of all my difficulties in *location_mentioned*Harrisburgh*/location_mentioned*, which surpassed all I
ever witnessed before— He has industrously circulated <hi rend="italic">falsehoods</hi>,
in various ways respecting me, and prejudicial to my <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>and
<hi rend="italic">Interest</hi>. He has not only made <hi rend="italic">false Statements</hi> injurious to me,
but he has gone so far as to swear to them*/p*<barker_pb n="869"/>

*p*This last he has managed so ingeniously, that I cant prove it on
him.—*/p*

*p*He refuses to respect me as a *person_mentioned*Physician */person_mentioned*not withstanding, upon
a personal Examination by the *person_mentioned*Medical Board*/person_mentioned*, I obtained a License,
and he refuses to give Judgments allowing anything—for my Medicine and Service*/p*

*p*He tells *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">people </hi>*/person_mentioned*that I am not a *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Physician </hi>*/person_mentioned*But applies to me the
Vulgar Term *person_mentioned*Quack*/person_mentioned*—so I am Creditably informed, for he never
has said it to me— This accusation is <hi rend="italic">false</hi>, and made use of to
injure me— I consider myself able to prove to any *person_mentioned*Judges */person_mentioned*the
Contrary—*/p*

*p*By his <hi rend="italic">Intrigue </hi>and Management I have been unable to collect
my <hi rend="italic">Debts </hi>here In no Case whatever have I had a fair chance, to
obtain Justice, He has chosen my Absence, and without giving me
notice to try all my Cases, He has called upon *person_mentioned*Men */person_mentioned*whom he could
sway as he pleased to Arbetrate— And I can safely say—before
him I have never had Justice done me—*/p*

*p*All This has resulted from the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, that I would not sanction
his <hi rend="italic">Unjust Measures</hi>, Nor suffer myself to be made his <hi rend="italic">Toot</hi>— To
remain in this condition is more Intolerable than <hi rend="italic">Banishment</hi>
<hi rend="italic">Itself</hi>— How to proceed I am at a loss, And Your Advice I hope to
obtain*/p*.

*p*On reflection, There occurs to my mind, Three modes of redress—.
and which to choose I am unable to Determine*/p*

*p*First a <hi rend="italic">Suit </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Slander </hi>—The law on that Subject, in this
*person_mentioned*Country*/person_mentioned*, I am unacquainted with, —And should the letter of the
law even be favourable to me, what chance I might have to obtain
Justice, Under present circumstances I dont know—,*/p*

*p*Second, To call on him, to give Satisfaction at the <hi rend="italic">Mouth </hi>of a
<hi rend="italic">Pistol </hi>—This I have two important objections to—first I am
seriously opposed to it by principle—And second, I have a *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*-
should, I happen to be <hi rend="italic">killed </hi>who would be left destitute, in a
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, without *person_mentioned*Friends*/person_mentioned*—And I might add a third in relation to
him, did we live in a *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, where men were respected agreeably
to their real merits—and where we were both known, I should—-
most certainly refuse to <hi rend="italic">Notice him</hi>—*/p*

*p*A third mode presents itself—which is. To leave the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*—.
This I have more objections to than the Second—That Course would
give Credence (here at least) to his Slanderous—and—-<hi rend="italic">false reports</hi>
And <hi rend="italic">Death </hi>Sir would be more desirable to me.*/p*

*p*I must believe, if you—and *person_mentioned*Capt. <hi rend="italic">Jno Austin</hi>*/person_mentioned* and the respectable
*person_mentioned*Gentlemen in General in the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*,*/person_mentioned* were in possession of the
truths on the subject, that you and They would enlist your Interest
in behalf of Justice—*/p*<barker_pb n="870"/>

*p*I have choosen you as my *person_mentioned*first adviser*/person_mentioned* in this matter, for the
reasons—That I believe if you will give advice in the Case at all
That it may be depended on—and I flatter myself that you Will
from your previous Friendship—and your knowledge of My-—
*person_mentioned*Father In Law*/person_mentioned*—whom I look for here again this *date_mentioned n="Winter - 1832">winter*/date_mentioned*—and
from my opinion of your desire to resent oppression—*/p*

*p*Whatever Advice you may choose to give I assure You, by me
shall be used according to your directions—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*J. G. Weight*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*[Addressed:] *person_mentioned*Col. Stephen F. Austin */person_mentioned* *location_mentioned* St Felippi*/location_mentioned**/p*
