*p*Austin to Samuel M Williams*/p*

*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="12-06-1832">6 December 1832*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*S.M.W.*/p*

*p*Dr Sir,   I arrived here on the *date_mentioned n="12-03-1832">3 inst*/date_mentioned*—*date_mentioned n="12-05-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*there was a 
meeting of the *person_mentioned*principal citizens*/person_mentioned*—that is the *person_mentioned*Chief—Erasmo [Seguin]*/person_mentioned*—<barker_pb n="898"/>
the *person_mentioned*Navarros*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Col. Elosua*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Balmaceda*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Flores*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Garza */person_mentioned*etc, and I
gave them an exact discription of the evils that are retarding the
progress of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. Stated in plain terms the necessity of 
separating from *location_mentioned*Coahuila*/location_mentioned*, and the desire of the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*generally to do so—
and said everything I could to induce them to concur in taking that
step at once.*/p*

*p*The matter was discussed and talked over with great calmness
and interest. There was not a dissenting voice as to the necessity of
a remidy and all agreed that a separation from *location_mentioned*Coahuila */location_mentioned*was the
best, but they thought it precipitate to take that step before any
representations of our grievances were made to the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*. This they
considered a necessary preliminary step. Finding that they would
not agree to go into the meas[ure] [before] the intermediate step of
representing had been resorted to, I urged the absolute importance
of proceeding immediately to take that step, by the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamto */person_mentioned*of
this place—that <hi rend="italic">All </hi>the grievances should be plainly and firmly
stated, and that the remonstrance should terminate with a positive
declaration that if our grievances were not fully redressed by the
*date_mentioned n="03-01-1833">first day of March next*/date_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*would then proceed immediately to
organize a *person_mentioned*local Government*/person_mentioned*—they agreed to this, but thought *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1833">March*/date_mentioned*
too short a time and *date_mentioned n="04-xx-1833">April */date_mentioned*was proposed and I think will be agreed to.*/p*

*p*The conference was unofficial, of course,—it lasted from nine A. M.
to 2 P. M.—they were unanimous, and I have full confidence that
what was agreed on will be carried into effect.*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*Ayuntamto */person_mentioned*is now in session on this matter to appoint a
*person_mentioned*committee */person_mentioned*to draw up the remonstrance, and I am of opinion that
the [most impatient man?] in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, will have no reason [to say
that] it is <hi rend="italic">too mild</hi>. They called on [me to] furnish the heads—
besides those [acted] on by the convention, I have given [some?]
others, including the whole system of the *person_mentioned*local administration*/person_mentioned*—of
colonization—of the *person_mentioned*militia*/person_mentioned*—all the violations of the constitution—
the insults offered to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, by the outrage on her *person_mentioned*representatives */person_mentioned*in
*date_mentioned n="09-xx-1830">Sept. 1830*/date_mentioned*—the law No. 50—the retail law, the insult offered to the
*person_mentioned*Lieut. Govr */person_mentioned*by calling a *person_mentioned*judge */person_mentioned*to exercise the government etc, etc,
usurpations—the neglect of the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, towards the *person_mentioned*people to the *location_mentioned*east
of my colony*/location_mentioned* and in *location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned* etc*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The object is to form a list of all the insults offered to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and
all her grievances and to <hi rend="italic">demand</hi>, full satisfaction. If it is not
granted, *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*can <hi rend="italic">then </hi>say to *location_mentioned*Coahuila */location_mentioned*and to the *location_mentioned*world*/location_mentioned*—we were
insulted and oppressed—we asked redress—it was refused, and we
have redressed * * * [If I succeed] in getting this *person_mentioned*Ayto */person_mentioned*to
[pass] this remonstrance, as I have pro[posed] and as was agreed
to in the conference *date_mentioned n="12-05-1832">[yester]day,*/date_mentioned* it will place *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*on much better
ground than to go into the measure now, and it will unite *location_mentioned*this place<barker_pb n="899"/>
and La Bahia*/location_mentioned* firmly with the balance of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, for they will be
so compromised that there will be no backing out, even if they wished
to do so; which they will not, for they are as anxious for a 
separation as we are, but wish to show to the world that they are right,
and stand on just ground in case force must ultimately be resorted to.*/p*

*p*I will return as soon as this matter is concluded.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Ramon Musquis*/person_mentioned*, after all, is one of the *person_mentioned*best friends to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*and
the truest that lives in this place and he deserves the confidence of
