*p*The latest information from *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*gives a very favorable account
of the state of public affairs, when compared with the events of the
last six months.*/p*

*p*The ' Plan' of the Army of reserve,' at *location_mentioned*Jalapa*/location_mentioned*, in favor of the
Federal Constitution, and system of government, has been sanctioned
by a decree of *person_mentioned*both Houses of Congress*/person_mentioned*; and the *location_mentioned*States*/location_mentioned*, in general,
have taken a very firm stand to the same effect. This unanimity of
public sentiment, once manifested throughout the *location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*, appeal's to
have quieted party excitements; and the *person_mentioned*Constitutional authorities*/person_mentioned*
are busily engaged in restoring order and organization to the 
different branches of the *person_mentioned*public administration*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*It is understood that *person_mentioned*His Excellency Gen. Teran,*/person_mentioned* is shortly 
expected in this *location_mentioned*department*/location_mentioned*, with a respectable body of *person_mentioned*troops*/person_mentioned*, intended
for the protection of our *location_mentioned*frontiers*/location_mentioned*.—The *person_mentioned*Tahaucana Indians*/person_mentioned* have
recently committed numerous depredations in the Vicinity of *location_mentioned*San 
Antonio de Bexar,*/location_mentioned* and are Daily becoming more insolent. The arrival of
*person_mentioned*Gen. Teran*/person_mentioned*, we make no doubt, will effectually check the predatory
excursions of those faithless *person_mentioned*savages*/person_mentioned*, and afford complete protection
to the *location_mentioned*settlements*/location_mentioned*. There is also much reason [on] the *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*
to expect that important benefits will result to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*from the 
location of an *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*in It, of the high military, scientific and moral
character of *person_mentioned*General Teran*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*This effort of the *person_mentioned*government */person_mentioned*to protect and foster the infant
*location_mentioned*settlements */location_mentioned*of this *location_mentioned*remote member of the Union*/location_mentioned*, affords an 
additional proof of the paternal care of the *person_mentioned*General Government*/person_mentioned* towards
the *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*.—If ever there was a *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*who have
reason to be satisfied with their *person_mentioned*government*/person_mentioned*, it is WE, the *person_mentioned*people
of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*.*/p*
