*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*As I contemplate becoming a *person_mentioned*resident of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, I feel great
solicitude about the nature of the population which will inhabit the
country I have been informed that you permit no one to settle
*location_mentioned*within the limits of your colony */location_mentioned*unless they produce vochers 
sufficient to convince you that they possess a good moral character 
indeed I beleive such is the law and I was truly glad to hear that
you were disposed to rigidly inforce it— But I am fearful you
may be imposed on for I do no of some very bad *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*who I have
been told are going there. There are a number of *person_mentioned*criminals */person_mentioned*who
after serveing in the *location_mentioned*state prisons*/location_mentioned* who it is said when they are turned
out look towards *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. The *person_mentioned*planters */person_mentioned*here have a most desperate
oppinion of the *person_mentioned*population */person_mentioned*there orriginating I presume from such
*person_mentioned*vilains */person_mentioned*as has been driven from among them and who have taken
shelter in that *location_mentioned*province */location_mentioned*There are others of my acquaintance whom
I got acquainted with before I came to this *location_mentioned*state */location_mentioned*who I have 
understood are now on their way there. I beleive they are from *location_mentioned*Tennassee*/location_mentioned*
and *location_mentioned*Alabama */location_mentioned*and I can assure you that I know no good of them
I do not wish to make specific charges but be strict in your enquiries
about character— I do not wish to mention names because I may see
them when I arrive there-™ A Gentleman expects to leave *location_mentioned*Attakapas*/location_mentioned*
shortly for the purpose of exploreing your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*If he gives a
favourable report I shall certainly remove there and endeavour to
carry along with me a numerous train of *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*who I am sure
you will find to be honest and industerous *person_mentioned*citizens */person_mentioned*and who will
bring with them considerable *person_mentioned*property*/person_mentioned*— The *person_mentioned*Gentleman */person_mentioned*above 
alluded to feels some apprehension of danger of robery by *person_mentioned*persons
liveing on the opposite side of the *location_mentioned*Sabine river*/location_mentioned* */person_mentioned*from this and is
waiting to get company to go with him a *person_mentioned*planter */person_mentioned*told me not long
since that persons who stole his horses fled to the *location_mentioned*Spanish country*/location_mentioned*
meaning *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. I mention these things to you to apprise you of
the objections which the most respectable class of *person_mentioned*citizens */person_mentioned*have to
comeing to your *location_mentioned*county */location_mentioned*thinking it probable that you would adopt
some means to have those lawles *person_mentioned*fugatives */person_mentioned*from the laws of their
*location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*driven away from this *location_mentioned*province */location_mentioned*As it regards your *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*
I have confidence in what I have heard that your intention is only
to admit respectable *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*But I am fearful that some persons
haveing the appearance of gentlemen will impose themselves— I
heard the other day of a*person_mentioned* man from *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* who says that he is
an *person_mentioned*intimate friend of Bur */person_mentioned*going to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*from what expressions
which I heard he dropt I fear you will find him a restless sperit
and perhaps a troublesome fellow—   Will you be so good as to write<barker_pb n="165"/>
me and let me know whether it is dangerous traveling on the *location_mentioned*other
side of the sabine*/location_mentioned* in consequence of *person_mentioned*Robbers*/person_mentioned*— I have heard also that
you have obtained an extension of your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*pray let me know
at what time I could obtain land in it as I was informed that it
was probable it would be ready for settlement this winter if that
be the fact do let me know and the terms on which I could obtain
lands for my self and five or six other *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*— I removed to this
*location_mentioned*state */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1828">last year*/date_mentioned* and have not purchased land yet— nor shall I 
purchase largely untill I see your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*or Know more about it from
the *person_mentioned*Gentleman */person_mentioned*who is about to visit it*/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Thomas White*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*Ps*/p*

*p*I shall leave here in a few days for *location_mentioned*St Martinsville*/location_mentioned* where I would
thank you to write me*/p*

*p*Since writeing the within I have been told by a *person_mentioned*gentleman */person_mentioned*that
there is liveing *location_mentioned*near the sabine*/location_mentioned* a man by the name of *person_mentioned*William
Knight*/person_mentioned* who brok geoil here and frequently crosses the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*and
commits depredations on the *location_mentioned*state of Louisiana*/location_mentioned* would it not be
wise to send a *person_mentioned*force */person_mentioned*and detect him and his *person_mentioned*bandits */person_mentioned*I presume that
the *person_mentioned*commander of the Mexican Troops at *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*would order
him and his *person_mentioned*gang */person_mentioned*arrested if information was given of the character
of *person_mentioned*Knight and his associates*/person_mentioned**/p*
