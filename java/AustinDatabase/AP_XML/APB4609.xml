*p*Dr Sir.*/p*

*p*The law repealing the 11 article of the law of*date_mentioned n="04-06-1830"> 6 april 1830*/date_mentioned*, was
passed by both houses, as I informed you in former letters, but, 
unfortunately it was not sent to the *person_mentioned*executive */person_mentioned*untill the day of 
*person_mentioned*Santana*/person_mentioned*s entrance into this city from *location_mentioned*Guanajuato*/location_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Gomez Farias*/person_mentioned* went
out that day and the *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">hero </hi>*/person_mentioned*went into the *location_mentioned*presidential chair*/location_mentioned*—he 
retained the law 9 days and returned it on the *date_mentioned n="11-10-1833">10th*/date_mentioned* to *person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*
requesting that its operation should be suspended for six months. This
was unanimously agreed to by *person_mentioned*both houses*/person_mentioned*, and the law was finally
published on the *date_mentioned n="11-21-1833">21 instant*/date_mentioned* so that the repeal does not take effect
untill the *date_mentioned n="05-21-1834">21st May next*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I think it doubtfull whether my letters reach *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, I will 
therefore merely say that I leave in about ten days for home by land—
perhaps I shall go on with*person_mentioned* Genl Pedro Lemus*/person_mentioned* who is appointed
*person_mentioned*Comnt Genl*/person_mentioned* in place of *person_mentioned*Felisola*/person_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Mejia */person_mentioned*has the command in *person_mentioned*chief
in the *location_mentioned*South*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* where the civil war [is] Still raging tho I think that
*person_mentioned*Mejia */person_mentioned*will soon terminate it. he is in the direction of *location_mentioned*Acapulco*/location_mentioned*.
and *person_mentioned*Genl Victoria*/person_mentioned* is in *location_mentioned*Oaxaca*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*matters are all right, nothing is wanted there but <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>.
No troops go with *person_mentioned*Genl Lemus*/person_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Santana */person_mentioned*hung up the State question
and wished to have *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*made a *location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*, and I believe that I
have been the means of preventing it and that question is also hung
up. This has made me a <hi rend="italic">goodly number of *person_mentioned*enemies*/person_mentioned*</hi> here who wished
for a *location_mentioned*Territory*/location_mentioned*—<hi rend="italic">nada importa</hi>—nil will go right. Close up all
pending matters. It is now very important to harmonise with *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*.
Keep this in view.   I shall be at *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*soon.*/p*
