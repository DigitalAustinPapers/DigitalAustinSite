<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I embrace the opportunity by <person_mentioned>Mr. Treat</person_mentioned> to drop you a line, I am
very anxious to see you but that is impracticable at present. The
state of things in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is I fear rather critical, and such as to 
require very great prudence on the part of the <person_mentioned>public Officers</person_mentioned> and
especially in the military and revenue departments. The revenue
regulations made by <person_mentioned>Fisher</person_mentioned>, as to their views are utterly 
impracticable and their execution is impossible. The <person_mentioned>Officer at the<location_mentioned> mouth
of the River</location_mentioned> </person_mentioned> has done his duty, so far as it was possible, I found
that a Flame was Kindling which if not checked would very soon
have removed the <person_mentioned>guard </person_mentioned>from this <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>and it would then have
spread and soon reached <location_mentioned>Anahuac </location_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mr. Fisher</person_mentioned>.   The conse-<barker_pb n="732"/>
quences you can imagine. You know your <person_mentioned>native countrymen</person_mentioned> and
you also know that at this time the <person_mentioned>people in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>have just causes
and very many of them to complain. In this state of things, I
wrote to the <person_mentioned>officer at the<location_mentioned> mouth of the River<</location_mentioned>/person_mentioned> and told him what the
true state of things was. My advise is to let this <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>alone and
let things go on as they now are, and as I indicated in my letter to
<person_mentioned>Domínguez</person_mentioned>, I cannot understand the policy that is pursued as to
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>if you understand it I wish you would explain it to me. This
is no time for ambiguity, for it will require all our management
united to keep things quiet unless a more Liberal System is adopted
towards the people. As we are now situated the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>will be
totally broken up and all commerce totally annihilated. Is that the
object of the Government—if it is I wish to know it. This <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>
never had a firmer <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>than I have been, do I merit or does the
<person_mentioned>people of my <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> merit to be shut out from the <location_mentioned>whole world</location_mentioned> and
have all their commerce destroyed.   I think not.</p>

<p>Please let me hear from you on this subject.</p>
