*p*I saw a man the other day at *location_mentioned*Harrisburgh */location_mentioned*who told me that
there were two horses*location_mentioned* between Dickinsons Creek and Clear Creek
*/location_mentioned*one a roan, they are represented to be gentle American horses—
have you found all yours or has any one in your *location_mentioned*neighborhood */location_mentioned*lost
any horses—if so let them know of these two—*/p*

*p*I hope you have not neglected to send to *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*for the peach
and figs and orange trees and to *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*H Austin*/person_mentioned*'s*/location_mentioned* for the grapes and
plums—after this month it will be too late to set them out.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Genl. Santana*/person_mentioned* has taken up arms against the *person_mentioned*present 
administration */person_mentioned*of the general government and has possession of *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned*
and the *location_mentioned*castle */location_mentioned*there. So far as I can judge by the *location_mentioned*Mexican papers,
*/location_mentioned*that part of the *location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*is in a state of civil war— I wish if possible
to keep peace in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and think that *person_mentioned*Fisher */person_mentioned*will be removed
from office in a few days and also that the *person_mentioned*guard at the*location_mentioned* mouth of
the river*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* will be ordered not to interfere with any vessels or perhaps
it will be withdrawn entirely.    I think the latter most probable.*/p*
