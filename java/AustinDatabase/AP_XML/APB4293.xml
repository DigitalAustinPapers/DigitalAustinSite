*p**date_mentioned n="12-01-1831">December 1st 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*My Dear *person_mentioned*Husband*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I was highly pleased to hear from you by *person_mentioned*Joel*/person_mentioned*, and of your safe
return from your last scrape, I hope to God that you will not
suffer by your being so exposed to the Cold for so many nights,
I am fearfull that it will give you the <hi rend="italic">Fever </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Ague</hi>, you are
not half as carefull of your self as you should be, how, careless
to go out with out your hat, or coat, I am really astonished at you
all the uneasiness that I have now is on your <hi rend="italic">account</hi>, for you are
so careless, of your self, I have to live so very much <hi rend="italic">exposed</hi>, I
shall be miserable if I hear of your being Sick, you must try and
come up, if you should be taken unwell,— I am very smart, the
*person_mentioned*Baby */person_mentioned*is not two weeks old, and I have been out into the *location_mentioned*eating
room*/location_mentioned* twice, as bad as the weather has been, we have the prospect of
a pleasant day at last, the first for two weeks,—*/p*

*p*I send you a <hi rend="italic">Plan </hi>of a House that *person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*sent down for me to
look at, I approve of the Plan very much, it will be a very
convenient, and pleasent *location_mentioned*house*/location_mentioned*, altho it is on a pretty large <hi rend="italic">Scale</hi>,
but not two large, if you think your <hi rend="italic">purse </hi>will allow you to venture
so far, if you could git the frame up, and the <hi rend="italic">roof </hi>on and 
<hi rend="italic">weatherboarded</hi>, by having one chimney and three *location_mentioned*rooms */location_mentioned*made habitable
the Balance could remain unfinished until], time, and money ennabled
you to finished it; at all evence you can make some improvement on
your own Plan by comparing it with the one I send you, I would
rather have more room thrown into the *location_mentioned*rooms*/location_mentioned*, and not have the
Passage so <hi rend="italic">wide</hi>, I should prefer having the*location_mentioned* Back-Gallery */location_mentioned*much
<hi rend="italic">wider</hi>, than the *location_mentioned*Front Gallery */location_mentioned*as it will always be <hi rend="italic">used </hi>more than
the Other, I approve of *person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*Plan as it respects that end of the
house, were the*location_mentioned* Childrens rooms*/location_mentioned* are struck of; also by deviding one
of the large rooms,—; but you can make such alterations as you think
propper, you are a better judge that I am how, large a *location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*we can
build, and the expence attending it; go according to your own<barker_pb n="721"/>
judgement, if Plank can be had to lay down on the Passage and *location_mentioned*back
Gallery,*/location_mentioned* by closing in three rooms, we could move down, (I mean
putting in doors and windows) the rest of the unfinished *location_mentioned*House */location_mentioned*would
do for the boys to Lodge in, through the Summer; I approve of his
Plan in laying off the <hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Grounds */location_mentioned*</hi>very much I wish the *location_mentioned*Back Yard
*/location_mentioned*to run down to the *location_mentioned*Creek */location_mentioned*and do not let the Boys cut down any of
the trees that will make a Shade, you know I am a great Friend to
trees and sh[r]ubbery— come up as soon as possible, for we are
all very anxious, to see you, write by every opportunity, Adieu—*/p*
