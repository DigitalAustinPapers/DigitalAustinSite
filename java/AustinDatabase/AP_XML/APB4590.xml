*p*I recd yours of *date_mentioned n="06-24-1833">24 June*/date_mentioned* by last mail—hope to get another letter
soon—this is the only one I have recd since I left. Has *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned*
returned—or is there no one there who remembers me so far as to<barker_pb n="997"/>
drop me a line to say that the few ties that are left to bind me to
life are still alive you say they have been sick (my *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*and
*person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*) but you say nothing of *person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*or anyone else*/p*.

*p*I think the decision of *person_mentioned*Congress */person_mentioned*will be in favor of a *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*, but
I fear they will send it to the *location_mentioned*other States*/location_mentioned* for their approbation,
this will cause some delay, tho my *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*here think it will be 
dispatched by the*date_mentioned n="01-01-1834"> first of January*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have had a hard trip so far and have more difficulties to work
through here than you can well form an idea of—but I hope to
get along and that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will be a *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*of this, or the *location_mentioned*U. S. 
republic*/location_mentioned* before another year, for I am so weary, that life is hardly worth
having situated as we now are.*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*vice President*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*ministers */person_mentioned*profess great friendship for
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and say that their measures will be very different from the
last *person_mentioned*administration*/person_mentioned*. I think they are sincere—but time will show.
There are conflicting interests—or what are supposed to be so by
some persons, that I fear will do harm—one article in the 
constitution which in reality means next thing to nothing I fear will do
some harm.*/p*

*p*Send word to *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*that I am well.*/p*

*p*The cholora is at hand and very fatal. So I bid you farewell in
case this should be the last.*/p*
