*p*My Dear Sir*/p*

*p*My object in coming to this place was to load the Schooner
Champion with lumber or freight for *location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned*, and I intended to
keep her in the coasting trade provided I found it to my Interest,
knowing it was decidedly to the advantage of the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*to have
a vessel as well calculated as she is to carry off their produce. But
I have to state to you with regret that unless a different 
construction of the maritime laws shall be made, or the laws themselves
changed, it will be impossible for any vessel to pursue it. I waited
on *person_mentioned*Colonel Bradburn*/person_mentioned* with the letter you honored me with, and
found him as you represented a *person_mentioned*Gentleman*/person_mentioned*. I stated to him that
I had paid in *location_mentioned*Aransaso Bay*/location_mentioned* a Tonnage duty on the Schooner, and
all the other Government dues for which I had a receipt from the
*person_mentioned*Administrador*/person_mentioned*; that after leaving there we entered the *location_mentioned*Bay of
Matagorda*/location_mentioned* in ballast, and finding no loading had come on to this
for lumber to proceed to *location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned*: he said his instructions were
positive, and that I must pay the tonnage duty here, and that had
there been an *location_mentioned*office at Matagorda*/location_mentioned*, the same would have been 
required there; and further, that the same must also be paid in 
*location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*: this then, amounts upon the Schooner whose tonnage per *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned*
Register is 65, besides other port charges to $552.50 from which 16
p. c. is to be deducted; no vessel can stand this, and unless a change
be made the Trade must be abandoned. I am not prepared to 
dispute the legality of*person_mentioned* Col. Bradburn*/person_mentioned*'s demand, but *person_mentioned*Mr. Hiram*/person_mentioned*, and
several other gentletmen here say they would not pay it, for *person_mentioned*Colonel
Bradburn*/person_mentioned* has nothing to do with this *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, nor has the 
*person_mentioned*ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*at *location_mentioned*Austin */location_mentioned*ever received any official notice of an *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*
having been placed at *location_mentioned*Galveston entrance*/location_mentioned*. I have no hesitation in
addressing to you, my dissatisfaction, but under the present feeling
between the two people prefer a slight submission (for submission
I consider it to be) to being the means of increasing that feeling.<barker_pb n="584"/>
I understood *person_mentioned*Colonel Bradburn*/person_mentioned* to say his orders were from 
*person_mentioned*General Teran*/person_mentioned*, and that as he conceived no vessel upon having payed
the Tonnage duty in one *location_mentioned*Mexican port*/location_mentioned* should be required to pay it
in another, unless her last clearance was from a *location_mentioned*Foreign */location_mentioned*one, he
would write to the *person_mentioned*General */person_mentioned*upon the subject, requesting him to give
instructions to have the payment made here returned in this case
and not demanded in future; but God help us! as the fable tells us
there are many tracks into the lions den but none out of it—he
further added that he would write to the *person_mentioned*General*/person_mentioned*, to grant to the
Schooner a coasting licence for six months, now my dear Sir, if you
would back this request by also addressing the *person_mentioned*General */person_mentioned*it would
oblige me.*/p*

*p*In the course of conversation the *person_mentioned*Colonel */person_mentioned*mentioned that the views
of the *person_mentioned*Mexican Government */person_mentioned*were such that he had no doubt but all
*location_mentioned*north american*/location_mentioned* emigration would be prohibited in the course of a
short time, even to this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*; should this prove to be the case, I
shall most truly regret it, for my attachment to this my *location_mentioned*adopted
country,*/location_mentioned* where I have located all my interests, and whose prosperity
I consider as identified with my own, is such, that I cannot view 
without pain a step of such short-sighted policy. The *person_mentioned*Mexican 
Government*/person_mentioned* have at all times been most liberal towards us *person_mentioned*colonists */person_mentioned*and
the people we have ever found to be amiable and hospitable; on the
other hand we have been true and faithful *person_mentioned*citizens*/person_mentioned*, ready at all
times to protect the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*from *location_mentioned*Foreign */location_mentioned*invasion, and *person_mentioned*Indian*/person_mentioned*
aggression, as well as to support the execution of the laws, we have
Industry and mechanical and agricultural knowledge wherewith we
can enrich the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and set a good example to our *person_mentioned*Mexican 
brethren*/person_mentioned*. Any step therefore on the part of the Government which might
check this Industry, and the good feeling existing between the 
*person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*native Mexicans*/person_mentioned* I consider injudicious.*/p*

*p*I shall forward this via *location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned*, and return in a day or two to
*location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. Rhoads Fisher */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*
