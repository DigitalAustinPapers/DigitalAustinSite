<p>Austin to Elias R. Wightman, August 20, 1830.   Instructions for surveying,</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="body">

<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="08-20-1830">Augt 20. 1830</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr E. R. Weightman</person_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr Ira Ingram</person_mentioned> informs me that you understand from my 
instructions relative to laying off his <location_mentioned>tract</location_mentioned>, that it was to be <location_mentioned>east of the<barker_pb n="466"/>
town tract, and that its northern boundary must be a due east line
extended from the S. E. corner of <person_mentioned>Lesassier</person_mentioned>'s league</location_mentioned></p>

<p>You are aware that I can not say what degree of the compass the
lines must run, or how many <hi rend="italic">varas </hi>must be given on each line, so
as not to injure <location_mentioned>other tracts</location_mentioned>, and give to each its proper shape etc, for
this can only be ascertained by actual survey.</p>

<p>The general rule which has always been observed and which you
must follow in this case, is to decide the local advantages of water,
timber, etc as nearly equal betweeen all the tracts as the situation and
circumstances will permit, and not to cross any leading or navigable
<location_mentioned>creek </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>bayou</location_mentioned>, or <location_mentioned>inlet</location_mentioned>—also to leave no vacancies at all in any part
of the <location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>, no matter where they may be—</p>

<p>In applying this rule to particular <location_mentioned>tracts </location_mentioned>you must of course 
exercise your own judgment and act under your own responsobility—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Ingram </person_mentioned>is to have a tract<location_mentioned> east, or eastwardly of the town tract</location_mentioned>— if
the situation requires that only <location_mentioned>2500 <hi rend="italic">varas </hi>front on the bay </location_mentioned>be given
to it and that it be run back <location_mentioned>behind the river leagues</location_mentioned> for quantity—
so let it be run— if it requires that 4000 <hi rend="italic">varas </hi>front be given—so
let it be— if the back line must run<location_mentioned> N.E.</location_mentioned> or any other course—so
let it be—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Wilson</person_mentioned> is to have the<location_mentioned> next tract east, or eastwardly—or north
eastwardly of <person_mentioned>Ingram </person_mentioned>fronting on the Bay</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Veeder(?)</person_mentioned> wishes his <location_mentioned>quarter </location_mentioned>run so as to include all the
branches of the creek, <location_mentioned>above <person_mentioned>Buckner</person_mentioned>s <hi rend="italic">labors </hi></location_mentioned>If it will not injure,
or interfere with any other <location_mentioned>tract</location_mentioned>, nor leave any vacancies, or irregular
shaped tract, to run it in the way he wished it—you can so run it—
but of this you must be the judge, for it is very evident that I cannot
and ought not to fix positively how the lines must run, for I have
not sufficient data to judge properly on the subject— you must
exercise your own judgment, and act on your own responsability in
the matter—</p>

<p>I made a mistake in saying that <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>S. R. Fisher</person_mentioned>s tract</location_mentioned> was on the
<location_mentioned>west side of the Creek</location_mentioned>— his tract is on the <location_mentioned>east side next below
<person_mentioned>Peyton</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned>— and <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Jaques</person_mentioned> on the West side</location_mentioned>— the <location_mentioned>creek </location_mentioned>at this place
cannot be crossed—</p>

<p>I presume that <person_mentioned>Hoit </person_mentioned>will not interfere with <person_mentioned>Fisher</person_mentioned>'s or any other
<location_mentioned>tract</location_mentioned>, if he does he must give way— he is to get his <location_mentioned>league </location_mentioned>it is
true—but he merits nothing—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>N. B. do not forget my <location_mentioned>tract on Live oak or on the lake below
the others</location_mentioned> which I spoke to you about</p>

<p><person_mentioned>A </person_mentioned>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed::]<person_mentioned> Mr. E. R. Weightman </person_mentioned>  <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned></p>
