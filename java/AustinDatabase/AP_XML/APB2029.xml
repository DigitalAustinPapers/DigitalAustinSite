*p*Austin to the colonists, June 7, 1825. Explains his authority under the Government, declares that he is willing to have a public investigation of his acts under this authority and has asked for one, but that the procedure of Buckner
is illegal and harmful to the colony. Therefore he has ordered his arrest for

*div1 type="body"*

*p*<hi rend="italic">To the *person_mentioned*Inhabitants */person_mentioned*living within the limits of this *location_mentioned*jurisdiction*/location_mentioned*—</hi>.*/p*

*p*Fellow *person_mentioned*Citizens*/person_mentioned*, I have regretted to see that a Spirit of 
discontent and contention has manifested itself in a few *person_mentioned*individuals of
this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* since its first commencement.—A rigid adhereance to
the instructions of the government would have compelled me long
since to have noticed such disturbances of the public peace; but
actuated by a hope that reason and reflection would lead them back
to that path of subordination to the laws from which passion had<barker_pb n="1125"/>
unfortunately drawn them, I forbore to exercise the authority vested
in me in such cases.—Unfortunately, my forbearance has been 
misconstrued, and has produced the opposite effect to that which was
hoped for and expected.—It has been attributed to timidity, to a
consciousness that I lacked authority, or, to a conviction that I had
violated the instructions of the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*and to many other
things of this nature.—.—*/p*

*p*The public peace is now disturbed, and the minds of many of the
*person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*publicly disquieted by the acts of these *person_mentioned*contentious men*/person_mentioned*.
It has therefore become an imperious, tho' a painful duty, to change
the mild course which has heretofore regulated my conduct, and to
bring them before the *person_mentioned*tribunals of the Government */person_mentioned*to answer for
their conduct.—.—So many misrepresentations, (arising probably
from misconceptions,) have been propagated relative to my acts, as
well as to those of other *person_mentioned*officers of the Government*/person_mentioned* who were united
with me in the organization of this *location_mentioned*new colony*/location_mentioned*, that, I owe it to
myself, as well as to every quiet and well-disposed *person_mentioned*settler*/person_mentioned*, to request
a public investigation of all my acts and conduct of a public nature,
since I came to this *location_mentioned*Nation*/location_mentioned*.—.—I approve of the principle that
every *person_mentioned*public officer*/person_mentioned* is amendable to the law for his official acts.—It
is the only solid basis upon which free institutions can rest.—I hold
myself responsible for mine, and have already requested, and shall
again, and again request of the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, that they should be
publicly examined. I recognize also, as one of the dearest privileges
of freemen the principle, that, every person has a right to seek
redress of grievances, and, <hi rend="italic">lawfully </hi>to meet, and petition the 
*person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*for that purpose, and I would ever be ready to lend my
feeble aid at any such meeting.—properly convened for the public
good.*/p*

*p*An invitation for a Meeting has been made and secretly circulated
by an *person_mentioned*individual */person_mentioned*whose turbulent and refractory disposition has
long disturbed the peace and public order, purporting to have for its
object an investigation of my authority, and with a view " to shake
off the Yoke and disperse that dark cloud that has so long kept
the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*in darkness."*/p*

*p*As regards this Meeting, I will merely observe that, it has been
proposed in open violation of the laws of the land, and particularly
that of the *date_mentioned n="01-10-1824">10th January 1824*/date_mentioned*, for those laws require an application
to the *person_mentioned*constituted authorities*/person_mentioned*; and no such application has been
made. This invitation proposes <hi rend="italic">"to shake off the yoke."</hi> What
yoke? the words have but one meaning—they are plain, and the
inference direct, which is the Yoke of the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*.—.—*/p*

*p*Fellow *person_mentioned*Citizens*/person_mentioned*, are you prepared to join any man in an open
rebellion against the *person_mentioned*government */person_mentioned*under which you have voluntarily<barker_pb n="1126"/>
sought a settlement? Which has received you with every public
mark of confidence and favour? Are you aware of the fatal 
influence it will have on your future prosperity, as well as the 
obstacles it will create against the admission of *person_mentioned*new settlers*/person_mentioned*, to 
impress on the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*the idea, that, the *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned*are disposed
at the very moment of their entrance into the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*,—while yet
at the threshold and even before their full reception is completed
and they are received in all the rights of Citizenship, to <hi rend="italic">array
themselves </hi>in opposition to the *person_mentioned*authorities */person_mentioned*placed over them? and
to doubt, suspect and distrust the good faith of the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*,
by declaiming, that, the *person_mentioned*officers */person_mentioned*appointed by it are without 
authority, and therefore ought not to be obeyed?.—.—*/p*

*p*I know that it is unnecessary for me to caution you against 
compromiting yourselves in any such acts, for I know, that, you will
never do it unless misled or drawn into error without reflection, and
this is the only reason why I now allude to the subject, and not
because I ever believed that any well disposed man would knowingly
engage in any act not sanctioned by the laws of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*. If
the object of the *person_mentioned*discontented persons*/person_mentioned* be an investigation of my
conduct by the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, I hope they will be gratified, for, as I
before said, I have petitioned the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*for such an 
investigation ; and I now declare that I will give a pasport to any person who
applies for it who wishes to proceed to the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*for the
purpose of entering complaints against me, and that, I will myself
sign any petition respectfully drawn up requesting an investigation
of my conduct by the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, and that such investigation may be
<hi rend="italic">public </hi>and at this place in order to give every man an opportunity to
come forward and exhibit his proofs.—*/p*

*p*My duty, however, and the positive orders of the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*,
relative to such cases, imperiously demand, that, open acts of 
insubordination tending to disturb the public peace should be noticed.—I
have therefore issued an order for the arrest of the turbulent 
*person_mentioned*individual */person_mentioned*before alluded to and shall send him to the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*to be
disposed of as it may deem just.—*/p*

*p*As regards the fees ordered to be paid by the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*on their lands,
I have to state, that, they were fixed by the official order of the
*person_mentioned*Governor of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, published on the *date_mentioned n="05-20-1824">20th- May 1824*/date_mentioned*, and sanctioned
by the most *person_mentioned*Excl- Provincial Deputation*/person_mentioned*, who ordered them to be
exacted as will appear by their official letter dated *date_mentioned n="09-24-1824">21st Sept. 1824,*/date_mentioned* A
translation of which is hereto annexed.—The *person_mentioned*Governor */person_mentioned*informed me
that they were in conformity with the <hi rend="italic">fee bill</hi> established by the
*person_mentioned*ancient audience [audiencia] of *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and other laws then in force;
Whether they are legal or not, the establishment of them was not my
act; it was the act of the *person_mentioned*highest authority of the then *location_mentioned*Province of<barker_pb n="1127"/>
Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and that authority most positively commanded me to collect
them, and my duty as an *person_mentioned*officer */person_mentioned*compelled me to obey the order.—*/p*

*p*As regards the quantity of land to be distributed to *person_mentioned*individuals*/person_mentioned*,
very great discretionary powers were lodged by the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*in
the *person_mentioned*Commissioner */person_mentioned*and myself, as will appear by reference to the
original concession, which, together with all the documents relative
to my authority, are at all times open in my office for inspection, and
an extract of which is annexed to this communication.—*/p*

*p*Whether any person who applies to be received as a *person_mentioned*settler*/person_mentioned*, has a
right to dictate to the*person_mentioned* officers of Government*/person_mentioned* how much land they
are to receive, and in what way the discretionary powers vested in
those *person_mentioned*officers */person_mentioned*are to be exercised—and whether I am bound as the
*person_mentioned*founder of this colony, (Empresario)*/person_mentioned* to receive every *person_mentioned*foreigner */person_mentioned*who
applies, and satisfy all his desires, or, submit to their unreasonable
complaints and misrepresentations.—And whether those who, for
such causes disturb the public peace of the *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*by their 
disorganizing clamours, are not <hi rend="italic">liable </hi>to the severest punishments of
the laws—and whether the colonization Law itself, and the authority
granted to the *person_mentioned*commissioner */person_mentioned*and myself, as the legal organs of the
*person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, do not, of themselves make a distinction; and 
contemplate that a very great one should be made in the distribution of land
to the *person_mentioned*new settlers*/person_mentioned*, according to their respective situtions, <hi rend="italic">are 
questions,</hi> which <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Laws </hi>must decide.*/p*

*p*The investigation of my conduct already solicited by me, and
which I now invite, will however elucidate these as well as all other
points. If, in my official capacity I have done wrong the remedy is
in the law—if those who have questioned the legality of the order of
the *person_mentioned*Government of Texas*/person_mentioned* relative to the fees required of them on
their lands, and who refuse to obey it, have done wrong, the remedy
is also in the law—and an opportunity is now presented to apply this
remedy as justice may require. The investigation sought for by me
will therefore at once show the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*the nature and extent of the
authority vested in me. All they have now to do is to support the
authority of the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, <hi rend="italic">discountenance </hi>the <hi rend="italic">turbulent</hi>, and 
separate themselves from them, and quietly wait the result, under the firm
assurance, that, the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*will be equally prompt in protecting
the rights of every good *person_mentioned*Citizen */person_mentioned*as in punishing the refractory.—*/p*

*p*By doing this, no one implicates himself in any manner, the public
order is not disturbed by illegal meetings, and the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*must
acquit every peaceable *person_mentioned*settler */person_mentioned*of any participation in such 
disorganizing acts—and also by adopting this course, even the discontented
will obtain what they profess to seek, which, is, an investigation of
my conduct, and obtain it legally without incurring responsibility or
blame,—.—Therefore in virtue of the authority vested in me by the<barker_pb n="1128"/>
*person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*as the *person_mentioned*civil and Military chief of this jurisdiction */person_mentioned*I
call on all the *person_mentioned*Inhabitants */person_mentioned*and other persons within its limits, to
unite in the support of the laws and protection of the constituted
*person_mentioned*authorities of the Government*/person_mentioned*, and I command them to hold 
themselves in readiness at all times to suppress any acts of 
insubordination, or <hi rend="italic">others</hi>, tending to disturb the public peace; <hi rend="italic">hereby </hi>forbidding
all meetings unauthorized by the laws, or unsanctioned by the proper
*person_mentioned*authorities*/person_mentioned*, under the penalties prescribed by the laws of the *location_mentioned*state*/location_mentioned*
