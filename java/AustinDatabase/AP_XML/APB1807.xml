*p*My Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have accompanied our *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned**person_mentioned*Genl Fullerton*/person_mentioned* this far and shall
return probably this *date_mentioned n="12-05-1829">afternoon */date_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Cincinnati*/location_mentioned*— I have suggested
to the *person_mentioned*General */person_mentioned*a speculation which I think promises great benefits
and I have no doubt of its practicability— It is the procuring the
exclusive right of navigating the *location_mentioned*Texas waters*/location_mentioned* Say the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*
the *location_mentioned*Brasos */location_mentioned*and the *location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned*by Steam—The *person_mentioned*Genl*/person_mentioned* and myself would
be happy to unite with you in this [s]cheme if the monopoly could
be obtained 20 or 25 years or even for 15 years it would be an
immense affair Should the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned* get the *location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*— Should you
think well of the proposition you are hereby authorized to sign
my name to a petition to that effect— I beg you will think seriously
of the matter—and if you do will summon up all your ingenuity
in drafting a petition so as [not] to leave a single flaw for the
jealousy of this government to pick at— It should [be] So drawn
as to embrace not only the *location_mentioned*rivers */location_mentioned*but all passes and passages from
one *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*to the other—the *location_mentioned*Netchez */location_mentioned*might also be included— I
have only time to hint at this matter—*person_mentioned*Genl Fullerton*/person_mentioned* will explain
my views more fully to you—   in haste*/p*
