*p*Dr Sister*/p*

*p*I am happy to hear by your letter to *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned* that you have a fine
*person_mentioned*son*/person_mentioned*, and thank you and *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned* for giving him the name of
Stephen after me You are likely to prove the truth of the *person_mentioned*old fortune teller*/person_mentioned* who told you in *location_mentioned*Philadelphia*/location_mentioned* that you was to have nine
children. A new *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*would suit such a family, tho I can not take
it uppon myself to advise you to move to this—*person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* must come
when he has leisure and look for himself—we have had rather a bad
year owing to wet weather but our crops are very abundant corn
I think will not be over one Dollar in cash pr bushel, except in a few
particular places—the Sickness has not been as bad as it is through
the *location_mentioned*southern country*/location_mentioned* generally*/p*

*p*I am about making arrangements to settle *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*a farm down
the Brasos*/location_mentioned* he has not much to begin with, but industry will push
him ahead—I hope to see him married before another year—as for
myself—it is very uncertain when I shall settle myself in that way—
if ever   I am too much in debt and my affairs too unsettled as yet—*/p*

*p*I wrote you respecting the *location_mentioned*Mine a Burton*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*Little Rock*/location_mentioned* business
a short time ago—*person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned* and myself will give any *person_mentioned*Power of Attorney*/person_mentioned* that may be required except to authorise the promise of money
I will not in any shape promise one cent of money on no account
whatever and unless there is a special provision in the *person_mentioned*Power of
Attorney*/person_mentioned* that we are not to be in any way responsible for costs or
fees or money to pay the *person_mentioned*Bank */person_mentioned*or for any thing else I will not sign
it—I am willing to give any share—the half—or any other share you
think proper but those who undertake the business must be at all
the expence and trouble for I cannot leave here to visit *location_mentioned*Missouri*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I do not by any means advise you to Employ *person_mentioned*R. C. Oden*/person_mentioned* to attend
to the *location_mentioned*Little Rock*/location_mentioned* business—he is very dissipated as I am told—
*person_mentioned*R. Crittenden*/person_mentioned* will be the best one, or perhaps there may be some new
*person_mentioned*Lawyers */person_mentioned*that I know nothing of-—you and *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned* must manage<barker_pb n="1229"/>
the whole affair as you think best.   I will approve of all you do
except promising money—that I will not—*/p*

*p*This *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned* progresses steadily in improvement—-tho not so rapidly as it would had the last season been more favourable It requires
much time to start a *location_mentioned*new Colony in a wilderness*/location_mentioned*, as this was I shall
close all my affairs in the course of next year I hope, and then if I
keep my senses I will never again have any thing to do with public
business—if I marry I shall settle down as a *person_mentioned*farmer */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*near the mouth
of this river*/location_mentioned*—if I do not, I shall likely ramble a good deal and leave
*person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned* to keep up the name and family*/p*

*p*Remember me to all *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and do not let the *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned* forget
their *person_mentioned*uncle */person_mentioned*when my little namesake is old enough I hope to have it
in my power to do something for him, I should also like to have
*person_mentioned*Austin*/person_mentioned* with me—that is if I ever get finally settled and in a situation to benefit him—we are all very healthy at this time and nothing
new of any consequence*/p*
