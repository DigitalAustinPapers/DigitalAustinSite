*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="04-18-1831">April 18. 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*I have drawn on you this day for one hundred dollars in favor
of *person_mentioned*Mr. Joseph Powel*/person_mentioned*, who let me have that amt. here. I think I can
get along with this. I should not have wanted any but I have agreed
to pay the office charges on the petitions that are pending from all
*location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, which will amt. to upwards of 200 dollars I expect.*/p*

*p*The present *person_mentioned*governor */person_mentioned*has carefully separated from the petitions
all who are not *person_mentioned*native Mexicans*/person_mentioned*, and will reject them all, he hates
all *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*as he does the devil and he must hate the *person_mentioned*old boy
*/person_mentioned*mortally for he is a *person_mentioned*fanatic en extremo*/person_mentioned**/p*.

*p**person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*can safely go on and issue the titles, that had the 
restriction, there will be no difficulty altho no definite or satisfactory
answer could be had from the *person_mentioned*Govr*/person_mentioned*. As a genl, rule you must tell
*person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*never to consult on any subject, unless he wishes to get
himself and everybody else into trouble.*/p*

*p*I have done all I could for *person_mentioned*Madero*/person_mentioned*, which is as much as to say
that I have effected nothing, for this *person_mentioned*Govr*/person_mentioned*. thinks that *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*is
a *person_mentioned*heretic */person_mentioned*and the more he suffers the better, as it will only be a
taste of hell in advance.   At *location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned*I may [do] something and<barker_pb n="649"/>
will attend to it. Inform *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*of this, or if as I presume from
a hint I saw in one of your letters that you and *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*and his
*person_mentioned*Comitiva */person_mentioned*are at cross questions because a paper was sent through
another hand than yours, you can get *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*to communicate.*/p*

*p*There is nothing new here since my last which was on the *date_mentioned n="04-16-1831">16th—*/date_mentioned*
the retail bill is asleep and I think it probably will so remain. The
*person_mentioned*pasquinades */person_mentioned*that were put up against *person_mentioned*Aguirre */person_mentioned*have not had the
effect which the *person_mentioned*shop gentry*/person_mentioned* expected, and I think the matter will
not be moved again.*/p*

*p*I send *person_mentioned*Johnson */person_mentioned*two seals, such as are used in this place.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S F Austin  */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*

*p*I paid forty dollars on the *location_mentioned*grants */location_mentioned*which I sent by *person_mentioned*Rodriguez */person_mentioned*which
you must collect*/p*

*p*[Addressed:]*person_mentioned* Mr. Samuel M. Williams*/person_mentioned**location_mentioned* San Felipe de Austin
