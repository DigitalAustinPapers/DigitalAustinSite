*p*You stated to me in a note [August 17] that the *person_mentioned*Spaniard */person_mentioned*who
owed me two horses had deposited his goods in your *location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*and
they should not be allowd. to be carried away until I was paid—
but that was not the contract with him and myself—for he was not
to remove his goods from my *location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*until I was paid and I was
to be paid some time ago and his contract calls for two Good Young
Gentle Horses under Six Years old delivered In my Yard—and I
dont wish to be running all over the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*to collect a debt when
It calls to be paid at *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*and As his contract was not to remove
his goods until I was paid I have let him carry off all but one bail
of Irish linen containing 22 pieces—which can be easily packd
on A horse when he pays me the two he owes me—and all I want is
my contract*/p*
