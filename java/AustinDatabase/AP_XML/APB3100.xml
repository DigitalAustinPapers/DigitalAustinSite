*p*The petition of *person_mentioned*Imla Keep*/person_mentioned* a *person_mentioned*citizen of said *location_mentioned*Parish*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, with respect
states to your *person_mentioned*Honor */person_mentioned*That notwithstanding he has used the greatest
industry and most rigid economy for years past he finds himself in
consequence of his numerous losses and misfortunes in a Condition
that renders it absolutely impossible for him to discharge his
debts—Your *person_mentioned*petitioner */person_mentioned*further states: that the step he is about
to take in making a surrender to his *person_mentioned*creditors */person_mentioned*has alone been produced by the positive belief that whilst encumbered and shakled
with such a load of increasing debt in consequence of the *location_mentioned*Rapide*/location_mentioned*
growth of the amount by accumulating interest and Costs, that he
never could by any rational exertion meet the payment his losses
and the payments heretofore made having divested him of every
useful means of making, save his personal exertions—Your *person_mentioned*petitioner */person_mentioned*further states that he has been placed in his present unpleasant situation of inability to pay his *person_mentioned*creditors*/person_mentioned*, by misfortunes
that he could not control and meeting necessary expences—such as
that of having lost his most valuable *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*, after having given a
large price at an unfortunate period for a *location_mentioned*plantation */location_mentioned*to employ them
on, That of having given fourteen thousand dollars for a *location_mentioned*plantation*/location_mentioned*—which was sacrificed for less than a third of the amt at
*person_mentioned*Sheriff*/person_mentioned*s sale. That of supporting my *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, though not an expensive one—Yet a losing one—That of not being able to collect
my debts and incurring their loss,—that of having at great expense
to attend to an expensive law suit most unjustly Prosecuted against
me in the *location_mentioned*state of Mississippi*/location_mentioned* These together with many other
causes not enumerated have produced my inability to pay my debts
and force me to take that disagreeable step of calling a meeting
of my *person_mentioned*creditors*/person_mentioned*—To which end I have hereto annexed a schedule
of my property and a list of my active and passive debts, as also a
Statement of the debts, due by me, and a Statement of the losses
that I have sustained—Wherefore your *person_mentioned*petitioner */person_mentioned*prays to be
allowd to call a meeting of his *person_mentioned*creditors*/person_mentioned* at such time and place as
your *person_mentioned*Honor */person_mentioned*or the *person_mentioned*court */person_mentioned*may direct, in order that he may be enabled
