<p>To <person_mentioned>Col Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir This letter will be handed you by <person_mentioned>Mr. David Roberts</person_mentioned>
of this <location_mentioned>county </location_mentioned>whom permit me to introduce to your acquaintance.
He visits your <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>in quest of some <person_mentioned>negro property</person_mentioned> which has
been fraudulently conveyed there, by <person_mentioned>Morris May</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Jacob and John
Buzzard</person_mentioned> of this <location_mentioned>Territory</location_mentioned>. The properly is also claimed by one
<person_mentioned>Andrew Pawley</person_mentioned> who I am informed is now in your <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>. The
<person_mentioned>property </person_mentioned>doubtless belongs to <person_mentioned>Polly Williamson</person_mentioned> who holds the same
under the will of her <person_mentioned>late husband Robert Williamson</person_mentioned> who died in
the <location_mentioned>county of Carrol in the state of Georgia,</location_mentioned> The title of <person_mentioned>May</person_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>Buzzard </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Pawley </person_mentioned>was brought before the <location_mentioned>court </location_mentioned>having 
jurisdiction of the matter in the <location_mentioned>county of La Fayette in this Territory</location_mentioned>,
the investigation of which exposed the most villanous scene of fraud
I have ever witnessed. <person_mentioned>May </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Buzzard </person_mentioned>by an order of one of
the judges here, were injoined for a time from removing the <person_mentioned>negroes</person_mentioned>
from the <location_mentioned>Territory</location_mentioned>, but another <person_mentioned>judge </person_mentioned>who held the <location_mentioned>court </location_mentioned>after-<barker_pb n="741"/>
wards who to say the least acted most unwarrantedly, dissolved the
injunction, and the <person_mentioned>negroes </person_mentioned>were conveyed into <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, before the
<person_mentioned>agents of Mrs. Williamson</person_mentioned>, who arrived in court a few hours after
the injunction was dissolved could have them detained. Your
friendly interposition in behalf of the <person_mentioned>widow </person_mentioned>whom <person_mentioned>Mr. Roberts </person_mentioned>
represents under a letter of <person_mentioned>Attorney </person_mentioned>will confer a personal favor on
me, further the ends of Justice and protect the rights of the <person_mentioned>widow</person_mentioned>
and the <person_mentioned>fatherless</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mr. Roberts</person_mentioned> in behalf of the <person_mentioned>widow </person_mentioned>will apply
to the Judicial tribunals of your <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>, to have her right to the
property Judicially determined, he informs me that he will be 
compelled to ask a postponement of the trial to such time as the <person_mentioned>widow</person_mentioned>
can procure such testimony from <location_mentioned>Georgia </location_mentioned>as shall be required by
the court. <person_mentioned>Mr Roberts</person_mentioned> is a <person_mentioned>Gentleman </person_mentioned>of truth and honesty and you
can rely with the utmost confidence on any and all of his 
representations. Any advice or assistance that <person_mentioned>Mr Roberts</person_mentioned> shall require you
will confer an additional obligation by affording to him</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Ben R. Milam</person_mentioned></p>
