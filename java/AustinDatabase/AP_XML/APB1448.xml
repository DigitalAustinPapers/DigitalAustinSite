	<barker_footnotes>The Trinity has been laid down as far, perhaps, as where the St. Antonio Road
will cross it. But not knowing the course and distance above the Coshata village nor
the creeks puting in nor the particular point at which the road crosses I have left that
blank which you may fill up at pleasure</barker_footnotes>

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. James B. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Sir Inclosed you will receive a rough *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*of that part of the
*location_mentioned*Province of Texas*/location_mentioned* lying *location_mentioned*between the Trinity and Sabine*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*Bound
north by the St Antonio road,*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*south by the gulf*/location_mentioned* The following
remarks will serve in some measure to explain it.*/p*<barker_pb n="1699"/>

*p**location_mentioned*From the San Antonio crossing of the Atoyac to its June- Course and distance.
tion with Angeline_*/location_mentioned*___________________ S 00°    —21 Mile*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*from Nacogdoches to the Junction of Toyac and Angeline*/location_mentioned*____S 44° E—35 m*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*from  said  junction  to  the  Junction  of  the  Angeline  and
Naches__*/location_mentioned*_____________________________S 16° E—26 m*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*from thence to Sabine lake*/location_mentioned*_______________________._ S 13° E—51m*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*from thence to the pass in the Gulf*/location_mentioned*___________________S 20° E—16 m*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*from thence through the pass__*/location_mentioned*__________________________S 18° E— 9 m*/p*

*p*The width of the *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*are laid down in yards *location_mentioned*opposite the mouth
of each creek*/location_mentioned* where the width could be ascertained. Their length
and general course could not be correctly ascertained. Their 
appearance on the *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*will perhaps be the best criterion. The width also,
of some of the *location_mentioned*rivers */location_mentioned*are laid down in yards at different points*/p*

*p*For further information I must refer you to the *location_mentioned*Map*/location_mentioned*, which is
laid down upon a scale of ten miles to an inch English measure.
The marginal lines will aid you as to the *location_mentioned*cardinal points*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I have not been able to learn anything that could be relied on
relative to the *location_mentioned*waters of the San Jacinto.*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned*Sabine*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*Sabine lake*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*pass into the gulf*/location_mentioned* and the *location_mentioned*coast */location_mentioned*on to
*location_mentioned*point Bolivar*/location_mentioned* and also *location_mentioned*Trinity Bay*/location_mentioned* so far as it is laid down, 
together with *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*puting in has been laid down according to 
instructions recd from *person_mentioned*Cap1 Orr*/person_mentioned* who has navigated these waters*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*Vills */location_mentioned*have been laid down partly from my own
acquaintance with the geography of the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and partly by
information from *person_mentioned*Capt Orr*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Mr Nash*/person_mentioned*, and a *person_mentioned*Coshata Indian*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*From
the St Antonio crossing of the Atoyac down the Angeline Naches*/location_mentioned*,
and the *location_mentioned*Sabine lake*/location_mentioned* has been laid down by my own observation as
I decended these waters last *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1827">March*/date_mentioned*, but without compass or 
mathematical instruments *person_mentioned*Capt Orr*/person_mentioned*, however, and others who are 
acquainted with these waters have agreed with me in the general
course and distances as laid down together with *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*The names
of some of these *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*could not be ascertained consequently they
were left blank I have no doubt but there are other *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*puting
in which I did not discover, as the waters were very high at the
time I came down. The *location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned*is laid down from the best 
information the *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*can give. But no doubts many *location_mentioned*creeks */location_mentioned*are
omitted.*/p*

*p*I am very sorry that the *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*which is inclosed is far from being
perfect, The want of correct information from the *location_mentioned*non inhabited
parts of the country*/location_mentioned*—the lack of mathematical instruments when
I decended the *location_mentioned*Naches */location_mentioned*and the little reliance to be put upon the
report of *person_mentioned*hunters */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*to whom I have been compelled to<barker_pb n="1700"/>
apply renders it impossible for a *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*to be perfect when founded
upon such vague data. But we must content ourselves with 
probabilities when certainties are wanting.*/p*
