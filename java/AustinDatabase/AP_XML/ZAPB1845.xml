<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have just recd pr the hands of <person_mentioned>Antonio Manches</person_mentioned> letters from
the <location_mentioned>U. S</location_mentioned>. bearing the disagreeable and unpleasant information of<barker_pb n="326"/>
my worthy <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>relative </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Samuel Summer</person_mentioned>'s being murdered
<date_mentioned n="Summer - 1829">last summer </date_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Sante Fe road </location_mentioned>by the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, also suspicions
that we are likely to sustain a considerable loss from certain 
imprudences of the man I left in charge of our business in<location_mentioned> New
Mexico</location_mentioned>, these circumstances render it highly necessary that I
should repair hence soon as possible and these circumstances will
further prevent my returning to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>for some time, but so soon
as I can settle our business in <location_mentioned>New Mexico</location_mentioned> I shall return by the
way of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, this I think will be some time <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1830">next fall</date_mentioned>, the goods
here I shall leave with <location_mentioned>Mr. Woodson</location_mentioned> to sell and make returns.
Our sales have been very good in this section, but light profits.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>are much agitated at this time relative to a change
of their Government. <person_mentioned>Bustamante </person_mentioned>seems to be the prime mover
of a <person_mentioned>central Govet</person_mentioned> and it seems from the best information I can
gather here, that he is very likely to carry his point, has many
<person_mentioned>followers</person_mentioned>. they urge as a principal reason for a change the 
expense of supporting the <location_mentioned>different states </location_mentioned>under the present form,
which argument has a priestly sway among the common people.
I have but little doubt myself, but what a central form would suit
them much better than the present, provided they had less 
<location_mentioned>Territory </location_mentioned>to govern, but it seems that <person_mentioned>Uncle Sam</person_mentioned> is pestering them
for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, at which some of them in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>kick against might
and main, but I think will ultimately bring them under, the <location_mentioned>U. S.
</location_mentioned>has, as they say has offered to loan them six millions of dollars,
if they would relinquish to her <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I have not much idea that
a very speedy change will take place, but am now inclined to
think it will ultimately, provided it could get through the <person_mentioned>senate</person_mentioned>
of the <location_mentioned>U. S. </location_mentioned>Here lies the rub. I presume it is hardly necessary
to name to you that we are all somewhat creatures of interest. I
am so much so that I have thought proper to solicit from you
a <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>for a small piece of Land say a League, should you think
proper to receive the application, you would render me a lasting
favour by selecting me a piece of your own choice, and should
you need any assistance call on my particular frds <person_mentioned>Mr, Williams
</person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>McKinstry </person_mentioned>to assist you, and any trouble and expense that
may be attending it, I will readily reimburse on my arrival with
you. Tender my best respects to <person_mentioned>Mr. and Mrs. Williams</person_mentioned> and all
my old frds in yr. city.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>E. Stowers</person_mentioned></p>
<p>P. S. Please write me on recpt. of this to <location_mentioned>Chihuahua</location_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed] Al <person_mentioned>Sor D Esteban F. Austin</person_mentioned>   <location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin
Texas</location_mentioned></p>
