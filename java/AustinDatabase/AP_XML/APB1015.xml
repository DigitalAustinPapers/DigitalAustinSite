*p*Col. *person_mentioned*Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr. Sir*/p*

*p*Agreeable to mutual promise I have the pleasure of now addressing 
you by mail, and of informing you that after a journey of 18
days from *location_mentioned*St Felipe De Austin*/location_mentioned* I arrived safe home: with the exception 
of some bad weather, and some high water, a pleasant journey. The 
emigrating, or *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned* <hi rend="italic">fever</hi> prevails to an extent that your
<hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> would no more than anticipate—It has pervaded all classes
of the *person_mentioned*citizens of this state*/person_mentioned* and the adjoining; from the *person_mentioned*men with
capital*/person_mentioned*, to the man that wishes to acquire a liveing—Nothing appears 
at present, to prevent a portion of our *person_mentioned*wealthy planters*/person_mentioned* from
emigrating immediately to the *location_mentioned*province of Texas*/location_mentioned* but the uncertainty 
now prevailing with regard to the subject of slavery—There
has been a parragraph that has gone the round of *location_mentioned*Nuse paper publication*/location_mentioned* 
in the *location_mentioned*Middle States [U.S.A]*/location_mentioned*, perporting to be an extract from a
*location_mentioned*Mexican paper*/location_mentioned*; which precludes the introduction of *person_mentioned*negro property*/person_mentioned*
into the *location_mentioned*Mexican Republick*/location_mentioned*, without exception: Subjecting the persons 
so offending to the severest penalties, and also an immediate
emancipation of thos *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned* now belonging to the *person_mentioned*citizens*/person_mentioned* of the
*location_mentioned*province of Texas*/location_mentioned*; and fredom to the <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*slave*/person_mentioned*</hi> that <hi rend="italic">touches</hi> the soil of
*location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*If this be a fact it will check the tide of emigrating <hi rend="italic">spirits</hi> at
once: and indeed it has had its influence already—I have pledged
myself to my *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*to ascertain the fact if possible; and I know
of no other way to satisfy the publick mind on the subject, but by
application to yourself for a copy of the new constitution, and a
promulgation of the same so soon as practicable—I have ventured
to contradict so much of the report and publication as relates to
your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*, upon the authority of your self, so far, as garranteeing
the right of that species of property under consideration—That por-<barker_pb n="1021"/>
tion of the *location_mentioned*Mexican Republick*/location_mentioned* is becoming every day more and
more an object of interest with this portion of the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned*—
There is not a day passes that I am not calld on to give (the superficial) 
information that I am in possession of as regards *location_mentioned*your country*/location_mentioned* : 
and have to regret that I am not able to satisfy the eager, yet
not <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> curiosity of my friends—If slavery is tolerated by the new
constitution I could wish, for the benefit of your self, and others
that you would petition the government for extension of territory,
and colonial location, so as to comprise the *location_mentioned*Trinity [River] and its waters*/location_mentioned*:
Three Hundred *person_mentioned*familys */person_mentioned*more can be settled in less than two years—*/p*

*p*A very considerable number of *person_mentioned*Gentlemen of fortune*/person_mentioned* will visit
the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned* this *date_mentioned n="Spring- 1825">Spring*/date_mentioned*, from this section of Country—with a view
of becoming *person_mentioned*citizens*/person_mentioned*—I will inform you further on the subject in
due time—*/p*

*p*The death of my *person_mentioned*Father in Law*/person_mentioned* during my absence has deranged
my calculations in some degree, as it may cause some delay in the
moving of my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*but it is more than probable that the whole
family of *person_mentioned*Col Kirby*/person_mentioned* will move when I doo—Please give my best
respect to *person_mentioned*Capt Austin*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Mr Williams*/person_mentioned*. Tell the latter that I
am anxious to hear from him, and likewise to receive a map of the
*location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*, which he promised—*/p*

*p*Be so good as to designate the bounds of my Labours an the Deed
so soon as surveyed, and send me a coppy*/p*
