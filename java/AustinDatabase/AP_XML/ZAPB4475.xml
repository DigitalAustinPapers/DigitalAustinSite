<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>: <date_mentioned n="11-15-1832">November 15th 1832</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Most Esteemed <person_mentioned>Friend</person_mentioned>. I agree with the sentiments expressed in
your appreciable letter of the <date_mentioned n="11-08-1832">8th inst</date_mentioned>. just received: "He is to be
pitied who has the misfortune to be at the head of public affairs,
in revolutionary times;" Indeed, be [he] a righteous man, or an
angel, he cannot escape the attacks of some party or individuals—
A rule we should always follow, is to do our duty, without 
minding what may be said: I on my part have always wished to follow
this rule, and my conscience is at rest: I found myself on several
occasions in rather a critical situation, but the polar star that has
always guided me, was to promote the true interests of the <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and I can say that as far as I was able, I complied with<barker_pb n="889"/>
my duty. With regard to the meeting, it did not originate with
me, but I believe some good will result from its action; the <person_mentioned>public</person_mentioned>
is satisfied, and we have enjoyed more quiet than heretofore.</p>

<p>As to your communication to the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamiento </person_mentioned>in relation to the
meeting, I believe that it would have been better, not to have written
it, <hi rend="italic">"Revolutionary times are not like peaceable times."</hi> Colonel
<person_mentioned>Bradburn </person_mentioned>could with the least prudence, have avoided all these
evils: I tell you candidly that in my opinion, it would be very
impolitic to translate, and print your communication, I shall not
do so. The <person_mentioned>Ayuntamiento </person_mentioned>may do as they please: In times like the
present, any measure is bad, that tends to irritate, and produce
excitement,—any measure is good that tends to soothe, and to 
preserve order and peace.</p>

<p>I have but little hope of obtaining anything from the 
<person_mentioned>Government of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; there is little probability that we may have a stable
and peaceable <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>, for some time yet, and I believe that
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is lost if she takes no measure of her own for her welfare.
I incline to the opinion, that it is your duty as <person_mentioned>first Magistrate</person_mentioned>, to
call a general meeting to take into consideration the situation of
the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>. I do not know how the <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>, or <person_mentioned>General Government</person_mentioned>
can presume to say that the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have violated the 
Constitution, when the acts of both <person_mentioned>Governments </person_mentioned>have killed the 
Constitution, and when the confederation itself has hardly any life left.
I cannot approve the principle, that the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>have not the right
to assemble peaceably and honorably to represent their wants. In
short, the condition of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is bad, but we may fear to see it
still worse.</p>

<p>I am settling up all my business and in <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1833">April </date_mentioned>I will go to the
<location_mentioned>North </location_mentioned>for six months or one year. There is little to be hoped for
in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I wish you would let me hear the news, and tell me if
the Constitution is dead, or alive, if an election for <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>shall
take place, and what hope there is for a peacable settlement of the
affairs. In the meanwhile please to give your orders to your 
affectionate friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
