*p*Dear Sir*/p*
*p*I have been much longer detained in this *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*than I had any
Idea of when I started from your *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, It was Six Weeks,
before we reached *location_mentioned*Refugio*/location_mentioned*, and have been longer in Settling my
business than I had any Idea of. I then went up the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*and
bought Some Wool to bring on to the *location_mentioned*Settlement */location_mentioned*but by high waters
and loosing Mules and Horses, it is only the other day I was able to
get my Cargos and Mules Collected in *location_mentioned*Camargo */location_mentioned*to start, but am
again prevented by high waters all the *location_mentioned*Water Courses*/location_mentioned* are up so
that mules with Cargo cannot proceed and I am uncertain when I will
be able to travel with my cargo there has been a great deal of Rain
in this *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*the *location_mentioned*Rio Grande*/location_mentioned* is very high and likewise the
*location_mentioned*Nueces*/location_mentioned*; and as I am unable to proceed, I have concluded to go down
to *location_mentioned*Refugio */location_mentioned*and purchase a few goods, to see if I can make up my lost
time; I shall be with you as soon as it is practicable; as I have since
I first saw the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*been determined to become a *person_mentioned*Settler*/person_mentioned*; and
have refused some good offers to make money, in consequence of
making all my arrangements to go and settle with you; I hope *person_mentioned*Captn
Jones*/person_mentioned* has attended to my business and that all things are well my
absence from the *location_mentioned*Colonies */location_mentioned*has not been my fault; which I know you
are sensible of— If *person_mentioned*Captn Jones */person_mentioned*has not been able to pay you the
balance; I will settle with you to your satisfaction.*/p*
