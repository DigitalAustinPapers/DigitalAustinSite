*p*<hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*</hi>*/p*
*p*My Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have before me your regarded favour of the *date_mentioned n="03-27-1831">27th ult°*/date_mentioned* and 
continuation of *date_mentioned n="03-28-1831">28th */date_mentioned*by which I am advised that my two letters of
the *date_mentioned n="03-09-1831">9th*/date_mentioned* and *date_mentioned n="03-16-1831">16th ult°*/date_mentioned* had reached you Our old friend *person_mentioned*Grande */person_mentioned*was
in the *location_mentioned*counting House*/location_mentioned* when I received your letter; and was much
delighted to hear from you, and requested me particularly to 
remember him to you He is one of *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1822">1822*/date_mentioned* and few now remain in the
*location_mentioned*City */location_mentioned*or even in the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*of our *person_mentioned*acquaintes */person_mentioned*[sic] and 
*person_mentioned*countrymen */person_mentioned*of that memorable Epoch; I am the only *person_mentioned*American */person_mentioned*that has
weathered the changes and vicissitudes consequent; of a continual
succession of revolution and *person_mentioned*rulers*/person_mentioned*, most of the others have for
want of perseverance or moral virtue, been obliged to return to
their *location_mentioned*homes */location_mentioned*and others have passed off in the storm of intemperance
and folly to*location_mentioned* another world*/location_mentioned*; For my part I have had a full share
of misfortunes; amidst; the smiles of prosperity. In *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1828">1828*/date_mentioned*, when
I had gained as much of this world's trash as satisfied my ambition,
I left here for the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* on a tour of pleasure, leaving the whole
under the management of *person_mentioned*Stephen J Wilson*/person_mentioned*, whom I had interested
in my concerns, with a view to better his condition and leave him
eventually with the entire controul of the mercantile relations I
had formed for some preceding years; I was upon the point of
Embarking for *location_mentioned*Europe */location_mentioned*when I received letters from a friend here
advising me to return forthwith or my *location_mentioned*House */location_mentioned*would be in a state
of insolvency from the bad management observed in its operations;
Though I could scarcely believe it, I returned immediately and to
accelerate my steps travelled post from *location_mentioned*Baltimore */location_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*New Orleans*/location_mentioned*
finding no vessel for either *location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*or *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz */location_mentioned*I freighted and
chartered a brig; on my arrival in *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned* in *date_mentioned n="01-xx-1829">January of 1829
*/date_mentioned*I learned the change in *person_mentioned*rulers */person_mentioned*and <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*saqueo */person_mentioned*</hi>of *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*by which latter
I supposed I was ruined as I was told my *location_mentioned*House */location_mentioned*did not escape
pillage; which proved in one sense correct for on arriving at *location_mentioned*Puebla*/location_mentioned*
with my family I recd an express advising that *person_mentioned*Wilson */person_mentioned*had fled
and that the *person_mentioned*officers of justice*/person_mentioned* were about to seize upon all they
could find supposing *person_mentioned*Wilson */person_mentioned*an *person_mentioned*accomplice */person_mentioned*in a Duel fought be-<barker_pb n="617"/>
tween *person_mentioned*W. Wilcocks*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*George Follin */person_mentioned*I again took post, and in
9 hours arrived in the *location_mentioned*city */location_mentioned*when to my great astonishment, I found
the surmise of my friend but too true; Bad management during
my absence; and all the available means carried off by *person_mentioned*Wilson*/person_mentioned*,
to the amt of 30.000$ and upwards; leaving debts to the amt of
near 50.000$ more; since which I have had to struggle hard to
organize every thing again; not having in the mean time been
able to obtain one cent from my <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*worthy partner*/person_mentioned*</hi>; all is going on
well again; I have been thus tedious to give you a full statement
of facts which may in part serve you; as I am told *person_mentioned*Wilson */person_mentioned*is in
*location_mentioned*your section of the country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I am well aware of the fatigue and perplexities you must have
necessarily undergone since our separation; for which I agree with
you, there can be no compensation; but the calm consciousness of
having done your duty not only in regard to your contract with the
Govt but towards your *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*; which will be better appreciated
hereafter, than during your life time; I thank you for the 
information in relation to my solicitude in favor of the *person_mentioned*Widow Ross*/person_mentioned* and
*person_mentioned*heirs*/person_mentioned*, I have no personal interest in it other than a desire to serve the
*person_mentioned*widow */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*orphan */person_mentioned*of a man whose maintainance was at my charge
during his stay in *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*without having received as yet any 
renumeration whatever; nor do I look for any, as his *person_mentioned*estate */person_mentioned*is insolvent
and the *person_mentioned*company at Nashville*/person_mentioned* refuses to pay me near 1000$ given
to him to keep him from starving while, in the prosecution of their
designs and his success in a great measure was owing to my friendly
interference in his behalf*/p*

*p*I have written to the *person_mentioned*Company in Nashville */person_mentioned*advising of the result
of my solicitude, I was not informed of the location of the *location_mentioned*grant*/location_mentioned*
made to him even. In my opinion, however, the suspension of the
colonization *date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">[law of 6] April*/date_mentioned* last will result to the benefit of all
con[cerned] in it who had not began at that period [mutilated]
for [that] law cannot nor does not annul the titles granted, and it
will afford them ample time to carry into effect their plans, Should
ever a change take place, less pregnant with groundless prejudices,
and unfounded suspicions of a *person_mentioned*neighbour */person_mentioned*than actually exists and
I am much in hopes to see a change ere long; when we will not be
regarded as an ambitious *person_mentioned*neighbour*/person_mentioned*, but as one willing to give aid
in time of need; and if allowed to judge from words <hi rend="italic">not deeds</hi> the
work of reform has already begun, tho we have a strong tide of
*person_mentioned*English */person_mentioned*influence arming against us, which in the nature of things
must have its ebbs and flows.*/p*

*p*With the hope of hearing from you whenever you have leisure,*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*W. S. Parrott  */person_mentioned* [Rubric]*/p*
