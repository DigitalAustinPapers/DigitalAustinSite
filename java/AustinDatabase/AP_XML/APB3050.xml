*p**date_mentioned n="01-07-1826">7th January 1826*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear Sir: I recd yours on the subject of *person_mentioned*whitesides—children*/person_mentioned*
feelings of Humanity was the only thing which Induced me first to become their *person_mentioned*Guardian */person_mentioned*and those feeling still Exist but why should I
Involve myself in a life time difficulty for those whom from acquaintance nor no other causes have any claims on me as for the
*person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*I pitty them their *person_mentioned*uncle*/person_mentioned* is not nor never will be capable of
dooing anything for them. But this is not my business he is their
*person_mentioned*Relation */person_mentioned*and I am not. therefore I am willing that you should ap<barker_pb n="1246"/>point him   I will give him the *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned* when ever he calls for them
My obligation as *person_mentioned*Guardian */person_mentioned*I shall Expect Returned to me etc—*/p*

*p*We burried our little *person_mentioned*daughter*/person_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="01-06-1826">yesterday */date_mentioned*she died suddenly I move to *location_mentioned*Bravo*/location_mentioned* next week you Inclosed an order from *person_mentioned*Joshua
Parker*/person_mentioned* to a *person_mentioned*Mr. Bell*/person_mentioned*, for 2 Horses in one of your letters without
saying any thing about It. I know nothing about it. what is the
meaning of it or what doo you want done with the order*/p*

*p*You say that the *person_mentioned*Goverment */person_mentioned*is displeased that you did not go
to war with the *person_mentioned*Wacos*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Coumanches*/person_mentioned* I am sorry to hear this but
sir we have better be driven out of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned* by the *person_mentioned*Goverment*/person_mentioned*
than by the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned* there is no one in the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned* that is more
disposed to defend the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned* than I am But as we are at peace
with those *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned* we must remain so and even put up with some
abuse from them until we are able to fight them If we get into
difficulty with those *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned* the *person_mentioned*Goverment */person_mentioned*is not able to assist us
and we are unable off ourselves to contend with them and my
oppinion is that the only policy for us is to let those *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned* alone
say nothing to them and If the *person_mentioned*Goverment */person_mentioned*will force us into a war
with them we must make the best of It. I am allways Ready to act
my part,    in peace or war*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Benjamin Edwards*/person_mentioned* was very angry a few days previous to his
leaving here with you and I am convinced he was Rong and I
believe I satisfied him that he was Rong for the want of paper I
do not Relate the particulars but we will speak of It when I see you*/p*
