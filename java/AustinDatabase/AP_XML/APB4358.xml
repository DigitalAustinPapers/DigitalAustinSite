*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Libiary,  Galveston,  Tex ]*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. M. Williams*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Dr Sir We have a wild account of difficulties at *location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned*. The
course to be taken is a very simple and plain one. Let a full 
statement of all the facts be made out <hi rend="italic">judicially </hi>keeping certified judicial
records, and send them on to the *person_mentioned*Chief of Department*/person_mentioned*. This is the
only legal and correct course, and it will put all things right. The
reign of *person_mentioned*military power*/person_mentioned* is over I think, and justice may now speak
openly and plainly—let a copy of the facts be published in the
*location_mentioned*paper*/location_mentioned*—but treat the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, and the *person_mentioned*officers */person_mentioned*with respect—even when
the latter have to be censured, let it be in mild and very decorous
language. Nothing inflamatory or passionate. But above all things
keep down popular commotions and all [acts] of violence. I know
nothing of this new cause of difficulty, but suppose that there has
very likely been some imprudence on one side—and some acts of
hasty and passionate violence by *person_mentioned*Bradburn*/person_mentioned*— the fact is he is
incompetent to such a command and is half crazy part of his time.*/p*

*p*Keep peace and harmony at all hazards. Now is a critical time—
it is said that a new and liberal party are getting <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, pray try and
keep the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*there from any acts that may be construed into
opposition to the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, for <hi rend="italic">that </hi>will <hi rend="italic">turn all</hi> parties against us.*/p*

*p*I leave in a few days for *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*where I expect to hear from you.
I wrote you from *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*just before I left I think on *date_mentioned n="05-8-1832">8 May */date_mentioned*and
enclosed a number of papers of value to others—also from *location_mentioned*Victoria*/location_mentioned*,
and *date_mentioned n="06-19-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*from here by *person_mentioned*Mr. Greaves.*/person_mentioned* I also gave *person_mentioned*John W.
Moore*/person_mentioned* an order on you for fifty, and one to *person_mentioned*Greaves */person_mentioned*for one hundred
fifty dolls also I send in the [word illegible] and mules and two
horses.*/p*

*p*Nothing new from *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*—nothing as to the *person_mentioned*new Ministers*/person_mentioned*.
*person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned* is at the *location_mentioned*Hacienda de buena vista del Cojo 20 leagues<barker_pb n="792"/>
from Tampico*/location_mentioned*.   When I left him on the *date_mentioned n="05-31-1832">31 of May*/date_mentioned* he expressed
himself very favourable to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*—tho. he was overwhelmed with
troubles and  Consejos—   also I wrote you the other day by a
*person_mentioned*[milit?]ary correo.*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*Prudence and harmony and legal proceedings—no violence*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*
*p**date_mentioned n="06-20-1832">June 20. 1832 */date_mentioned*  Matamoros*/p*
