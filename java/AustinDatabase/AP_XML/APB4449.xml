*p*My dear Sir*/p*

*p*I *date_mentioned n="10-13-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*received your letters of the *date_mentioned n="08-13-1832">13*/date_mentioned* and *date_mentioned n="08-29-1832">29 August*/date_mentioned* and
am very much indebted to you for this mark of your kind remem-<barker_pb n="876"/>
brance as well as for the intelligence they contain— I am really
sorry to find that *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*should continue to be so convulsed even
after the *person_mentioned*arch fiend*/person_mentioned* has left the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*— What will *person_mentioned*Pakenham*/person_mentioned*
say now— I did not raise the insurrection this time nor am I
in anyway the cause of the revolt in the *location_mentioned*States*/location_mentioned*-— It is inconceivable
that he and his *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*should have been so weak as to attribute
to me what is owing to the character of the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*and their 
ignorance of self government— I dare say you will get along very well
with *person_mentioned*Fagoaga*/person_mentioned*, but doubt whether you will have long to get on
with him— He has not I think, talents for the place he fills—
You seem in the dark as [to] his predilections and the cause of
*person_mentioned*Pakenham*/person_mentioned*'s coolness and even dissatisfaction with the appointment
and I can account for both and give you a little secret history,
which may be of use to you In *person_mentioned*Alaman*/person_mentioned*'s first reign as *person_mentioned*Secretary
of State*/person_mentioned*, he desired to send this very *person_mentioned*Fagoaga */person_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*London*/location_mentioned*-— *person_mentioned*Victoria*/person_mentioned*
objected and*person_mentioned* Mr. Ward*/person_mentioned* objected; but *person_mentioned*Alaman */person_mentioned*who had at heart this
nomination addressed himself severally to the *person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*and the
*person_mentioned*british Charge*/person_mentioned*— To the *person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*he said that he ought to 
overcome his objections because *person_mentioned*Mr. Ward*/person_mentioned* had expressed an earnest
desire to have *person_mentioned*Fagoaga */person_mentioned*appointed to his *person_mentioned*Court*/person_mentioned*—and to *person_mentioned*Ward */person_mentioned*that
the *person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*desired this so much that he thought the objections
he had advanced ought to be withdrawn—*/p*

*p*At length an eclaricissiment took place between the *person_mentioned*parties*/person_mentioned*— The
*person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*apologised and expressed his regret that he could not
oblige *person_mentioned*Mr. Ward*/person_mentioned* in this matter, the other was stupefied— They
mutually explained, and agreed that the *person_mentioned*secretary */person_mentioned*had sought to
serve them both a scurvy trick— *person_mentioned*Ward */person_mentioned*called at my *location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*on his
return from this interview at the *location_mentioned*palace */location_mentioned*He was shocked at the
duplicity of *person_mentioned*Alaman*/person_mentioned*— He then told me, that *person_mentioned*Fagoaga*/person_mentioned*'s 
predelections were altogether french—that he was a Bourbonite and that it
was certain the *person_mentioned*french ambassador in *location_mentioned*London*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* would be instantly
informed of every thing which passed between *person_mentioned*Mr Canning*/person_mentioned*
and the *person_mentioned*Mexican Envoy*/person_mentioned* He was right—all the *person_mentioned*Fagoaga*/person_mentioned*'s are
*person_mentioned*french */person_mentioned*in their predilections—*person_mentioned*Jose Maria */person_mentioned*desired the ratification
of the plan of *location_mentioned*Iguala */location_mentioned*and treaties of *location_mentioned*Cordova */location_mentioned*and so did this
*person_mentioned*Sor- Dn Francisco*/person_mentioned*— I thank him however for his compliments to
our *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and sorry I am to say they are not deserved— 
Ambitious and bad *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*are exciting the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*against the *person_mentioned*federal 
government*/person_mentioned*— *person_mentioned*Calhoun*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Hamilton*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*McDuffie */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Hayne */person_mentioned*have driven
our *person_mentioned*countrymen */person_mentioned*stark mad and our once loyal and glorious little
*location_mentioned*state */location_mentioned*is about to disgrace herself and bring ruin upon her *person_mentioned*citizens*/person_mentioned*—
We have used every exertion to check them in their mad career,
but in vain— They have gained almost all the elections and will
in all probability have a *person_mentioned*constitutional majority*/person_mentioned* in favor of conven-<barker_pb n="877"/>
tions— In this hope the *person_mentioned*Governor */person_mentioned*has called together the 
*person_mentioned*Legislature */person_mentioned*for *date_mentioned n="10-22-1832">monday next*/date_mentioned*— The object is to call a convention of the
*person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*and nullify the tariff act— If *person_mentioned*General Jackson*/person_mentioned* is reelected
I have no fears of the result— He will I am sure act with vigour
and put down these *person_mentioned*nullifiers*/person_mentioned*, forever— It is a hard case to stand
by and see our *location_mentioned*city */location_mentioned*ruined by these *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, who are guided alone by
their personal ambition— We had a most animated contest and
the union party put itself under my guidance, but it had been so
mismanaged, that I could not restore it to order in the short time
I had the command—not three weeks, We will do better in 
another year if the contest is not decided by the Sword before that
period—- In *location_mentioned*every other part of the United States*/location_mentioned* there reigns the
most perfect tranquillity and unparallelled prosperity—Even here
if these *person_mentioned*agitators */person_mentioned*would let us alone, we are more prosperous than I
have ever known *location_mentioned*Carolina */location_mentioned*to be— I cannot think of them or write
of them with any patience— I will inform you soon of what our
assembly of wise *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*do at *location_mentioned*Columbia*/location_mentioned*— I cannot doubt of *person_mentioned*Genl
Jackson*/person_mentioned*'s reelection—*/p*
