*p**person_mentioned*T. H. Benton*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="06-xx-1830">About eighteen months*/date_mentioned* since I had the pleasure of receiving your
friendly letters introducing *person_mentioned*Col Woodbery*/person_mentioned* who visited this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
with a view to a permanent Settlement and removal of his *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I afforded *person_mentioned*Col. W.*/person_mentioned* all the assistance and gave him all the 
information in my power, as it will always give me pleasure to do to any of
your *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*who may visit this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The particular object of this letter (after acknowledgeing the
recept of yours by*person_mentioned* Col. W. */person_mentioned*and assuring you that our former 
acquaintance, in *location_mentioned*Missouri */location_mentioned*is still fresh on my memory,) is to 
recommend to you the bearer*person_mentioned* Mr. W. B. Travis*/person_mentioned*, who probably will apply
for the appointment of*person_mentioned* U. S. consul for the *location_mentioned*Harbor and Bay of
Galveston */location_mentioned*in Texas*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*My personal acquaintance with*person_mentioned* Mr T.*/person_mentioned* is very short and limited,
he has been recommended to me by *person_mentioned*persons of respectability*/person_mentioned* and I
can with full confidence say that he has acquired the esteem and
respect of the better part of the people in the section of *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
where he resides which is on the *location_mentioned*Trinity river near the head of 
Galveston bay*/location_mentioned*, and I have my self no hesitation in recommending him
as a suitable person for the appointment of *person_mentioned*Consul*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*when thickly settled will no doubt require four *person_mentioned*consuls */person_mentioned*or
*person_mentioned*vice consuls*/person_mentioned* on its *location_mentioned*sea board*/location_mentioned*—one for *location_mentioned*Galveston*/location_mentioned*, one for *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*at
the *location_mentioned*mouth of the Brazos river*/location_mentioned*, one for *location_mentioned*Matagorda bay*/location_mentioned*, and one for
*location_mentioned*Aransao and the Neucis bay—*/location_mentioned*At this time I think the location of a
*person_mentioned*consul */person_mentioned*at some point on *location_mentioned*Galveston bay*/location_mentioned*, with authority to appoint
*person_mentioned*vice consuls*/person_mentioned* for the *location_mentioned*Brazos */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned*, would do—or *person_mentioned*consuls*/person_mentioned*
might very properly I think be appointed now for the *location_mentioned*Brazos */location_mentioned*and
*location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned*—The most of the business of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*is now done through
*location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*near the mouth of the Brazos river*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I directed my *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*in *location_mentioned*Phia */location_mentioned*to send you a copy of the *location_mentioned*map */location_mentioned*which
I compiled of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, published by *person_mentioned*Mr Tanner*/person_mentioned* which I hope you recd,
and which will give you a correct general idea of the points I speak
of and of all *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, it is not of course topografically correct, but
I think is as much so as the first maps of *location_mentioned*unsurveyed countries*/location_mentioned* 
generally are, and perhaps more so—*/p*
