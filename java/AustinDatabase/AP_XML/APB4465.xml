*p*I believe I have nearly got through the troublesome business
of settling my affairs with the *person_mentioned*Hawkins estate*/person_mentioned* and I have in this
settlement given up at least one fourth of what I was entitled to,
in order to have it finally finished and off my mind.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr Perry*/person_mentioned* is going on very well and will soon have some *location_mentioned*cabbins*/location_mentioned*
up, I have a situation joining him so that after a while we will
be near together,*location_mentioned* within half a mile*/location_mentioned*, and I hope shall yet enjoy
some peace in each others society—it distracts <hi rend="italic">me </hi>to see you 
unhappy—everything has turned out differently from what I expected
when I first wrote to *person_mentioned*Perry */person_mentioned*to move, the prospects were then very
good and the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned**location_mentioned*in peace, but if you were satisfied I should
not be at all discouraged at the present state of things—this country*/location_mentioned*
must prosper in the end, it cannot be otherwise-—*date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1832">this year*/date_mentioned* has been
bad—unusually wet, and filled with trouble, but *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">next year */date_mentioned*will be
much better—this world is all trouble, or not so bad, just as we
chuse to make it—<hi rend="italic">content </hi>is everything.*/p*
