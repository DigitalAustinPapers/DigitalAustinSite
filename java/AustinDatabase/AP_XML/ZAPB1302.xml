<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,<location_mentioned>Saltill° </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-10-1826">0ct 10th 1826<</date_mentioned>/p> 
<p>I wrote you <date_mentioned n="10-07-1826">two or three days since</date_mentioned> and calculated before this to
have been in or near <location_mentioned>Monterrey </location_mentioned>but <date_mentioned n="10-09-1826">last evening</date_mentioned> I received inteli-<barker_pb n="1474"/>
gence that a <person_mentioned>band of Robbers </person_mentioned>had stationed themselves <location_mentioned>on the road
</location_mentioned>to attack the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>who might be returning to <location_mentioned>Refugio </location_mentioned>from the
<location_mentioned>fair </location_mentioned>and what <person_mentioned>americans </person_mentioned>are in this place have concluded to join
together for their mutual defense—We certainly start the <date_mentioned n="10-12-1826">day after
tomorrow</date_mentioned>—- have this moment taken my leave of the <person_mentioned>members of
the Legislature</person_mentioned>—they have assured me to dispel all doubts relative
to the 13 Art.—The representation you made on the subject appeared
so just and well founded that the <person_mentioned>Author of the <hi rend="italic">Article </hi></person_mentioned>himself
(<person_mentioned>Carrillo</person_mentioned>) asked permission to withdraw it—I think the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>
born after the publication of the Constitution will not be freed under
fourteen: Several of the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>since I have proposed it, are 
inclined not to free them under the age of 25 or 21-—the arguments and
reasons adduced by myself to convince them of the <hi rend="italic">justice </hi>and 
necessity of this law are to lengthy to insert in this communication but
the principle was the <hi rend="italic">advantage </hi>that would result to the <person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>as
well as to the <person_mentioned>Public </person_mentioned>to be freed at that age possessed of some useful
branch of industry whereby they might gain a livelihood—instead of
becoming <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>vagabonds </person_mentioned></hi>and [illegible] ; without any certain way of 
procuring the necessaries of life except in a dishonest manner—which
must be the case if they are freed at 14. after that age they are 
compelled to stay no longer with their <person_mentioned>masters </person_mentioned>unless they choose—At
any rate it is presumable that no <person_mentioned>Master </person_mentioned>will maintain a large <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>
of <person_mentioned>young Negroes </person_mentioned>a term of years without receiving some 
compensation for it—and I say for the trouble and expence the <person_mentioned>master </person_mentioned>is at
to maintain them from the time they are born untill they are 14—
let the <person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>serve a few years to recompense them—after that he
can be <hi rend="italic">freed </hi>possessing health, strength; and <hi rend="italic">Means </hi>to support 
himself without being a <person_mentioned>Public pest</person_mentioned> and continually a <person_mentioned>subject of 
correction</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have stated every <hi rend="italic">reason </hi>that I can invent—to try and procure
this last clause as favourable as possible—I am confident if I had not
arrived here, the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>would have been declared <person_mentioned>free </person_mentioned>from their
birth—and if the <hi rend="italic">Art </hi>is <hi rend="italic">passed</hi>—extending the period of 
Emancipation to 14—21—or 25—I shall flatter <hi rend="italic">myself </hi>as <hi rend="italic">contributing </hi>in a
small degree in obtaining it—</p>

<p>Since my last to you I have had much conversation (reserved) with
<person_mentioned>Padilla </person_mentioned>relative to your situation—and touching the subjects 
generally you have addressed him upon—</p>

<p>he is your <hi rend="italic">warm </hi>and <hi rend="italic">disinterested <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned></hi>—he informs me that he
is <hi rend="italic">afraid </hi>at present to do much on the various points you have been
so frank as to submit to his consideration—because he has no 
confidence in the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>composing the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>except the <person_mentioned>Baron</person_mentioned>
and one or two others the ballance I may say are bought by <person_mentioned>Carrillo</person_mentioned>-
he says have patience—as soon as the new <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>takes its seat-
he will present the points you wish granted and has no doubt of sue-<barker_pb n="1475"/>
cess in the mean time lie says you can present any thing else that
you wish—and consider him as your legal <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned></hi>in all yr transactions
with Govt</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Saucedo </person_mentioned>is also yr. warm <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>you must cultivate the same
friendship for him that has always existed— If he is appointed
the <person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>to pass to the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>I expect <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Arcinega </person_mentioned></hi>will be
appointed his <person_mentioned>Secretary</person_mentioned>— No doubt you will receive the 
appointment of <hi rend="italic">Gefe Subalterno</hi>— This is proof that the <person_mentioned>Govr </person_mentioned>has a
friendly disposition towards you, As to <person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>he is so Contemptious
that I have declined makeing any representation to the Gov on
<hi rend="italic">paper</hi>— I have conversed with all the <person_mentioned>Members </person_mentioned>respecting him—
and referred them to the <person_mentioned>Baron</person_mentioned>— When the subject comes before
the <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>— I shall not be surprised if those letters be the cause
of his expulsion from the <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned></hi>—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>have left no <hi rend="italic">method untryed</hi> but on the contrary have
used every exertion to induce the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned> to regard the <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>
with jealousy and suspicion— They have used all their <hi rend="italic">intrigue</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">influence </hi>to injure the <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>of the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and many
representations have been made in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>against Amern 
Emigration but the Govt, attributed it to Ambition and <hi rend="italic">that </hi>natural 
antipathy the <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>possess towards us— Respects to all <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
the <person_mentioned>Barron </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Padilla </person_mentioned>wish to be remerd—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jas B Austin </person_mentioned>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>P. S. I have just seen the <person_mentioned>Comt Genl</person_mentioned> he appeared glad to see me
and wishes me to remember him to you he also observed that he
hoped to give you u <hi rend="italic">un Abrazo</hi> " between this and <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1827">next fall</date_mentioned>, he says
" <hi rend="italic">consider him as your <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>, and old acquaintance</hi> " he also 
observed that you need have no trouble about the letters <person_mentioned>Gaines </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>Norris </person_mentioned>have been writing for men of that stamp are not calculated to
injure you.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Baron </person_mentioned>says <hi rend="italic">twig </hi>old <person_mentioned>McFarland</person_mentioned>s memory about some bacon
he was to have paid long <hi rend="italic">since </hi>he wishes it delivered to the order of
