*p*My dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have at last reach'd this place with the steamboat and purpose
ascending the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*on *date_mentioned n="08-28-1830">Saturday next*/date_mentioned* so far as the water will permit*/p*

*p*It is believed here that I shall not get higher than *location_mentioned*Bolivar */location_mentioned*in
the present state of the water—in which case I shall take horses
and visit you at *location_mentioned*St Filipi*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I am much pleased with the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*so far as I have seen it
The *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*to this place is of much easier and safer navigation than
the one I have left—but I doubt whether a steamboat can be 
supported on it unless it can be made navigable in the ordinary state
of the waters as far as your *location_mentioned*town */location_mentioned*and a communication opened with
a ship anchorage in *location_mentioned*Galveston bay*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*It is obviously important to the prosperity of the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*that
these two objects should be attained promptly whether practicable
or not can only be judged of on actual survey and then the means
of accomplishing works of such magnitude may not be readily 
obtained— Still I think that if you concur with me in the opinion
of the importance and advantages of the work a plan may be devised
to carry it into effect— at all events I must come to a prompt 
decision as to the future disposition of the boat as the expense of her is
too great to be supported in idleness*/p*<barker_pb n="474"/>

*p*The last I heard of my application to the Govt, for a grant of
land was that it had been sent to you for your signature and when
returned the solicitation would be acceeded to*/p*

*p*I hope it reached you and may be in due course—*/p*

*p*I shall be with you in a few days—*/p*
