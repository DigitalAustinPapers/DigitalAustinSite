<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="08-26-1834">26 August 1834</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. E. W- Gregory</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir. I enclose you a letter for my <person_mentioned>brother in law Mr.
James F. Perry</person_mentioned>, of <location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>which I must beg the favour of you
to forward by the first safe opportunity</p>

<p>I am still in confinement but expect a favourable change in my
situation soon</p>

<p>The political affairs of this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>are all quiet I have no doubt
that the political intentions of the <person_mentioned>President Gen Santa Ana</person_mentioned> are
sound and patriotic, he wishes to get a <person_mentioned>general congress</person_mentioned> togather
in <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1835">January next</date_mentioned>, freely elected by the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>, with the powers of a
National convention in order to reestablish the Constitution which
has been so dreadfully outraged by all parties that none respect it. I
do not think he has designs to change the system of Government.
At least not in its principal features. He has put a stop to the system
of banishment and imprisonment, and recalled all the banished a
very just humane and necessary measure.</p>

<p>The past events in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>have cost me very dear. I was 
precipitated into them by the excitements and circumstances of the times It
is a consolation to me that I am the only one who has suffered by
them and that much good has resulted to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and also to the
<location_mentioned>Mexican republic </location_mentioned>from those events. The evils complained of in
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>have been remedied by the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>on the one hand and
on the other the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>have become convinced of the
dangers of political excitements and of listening to political fanatics
and political adventurers they will consequently be on their guard<barker_pb n="1086"/>
against such dangers in future. My motto always has been <hi rend="italic">Fidelity
to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, opposition to <person_mentioned>violent men</person_mentioned> or measures</hi> it is the only
sound rule for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I am more convinced of it now than ever, tho
I never doubted it notwithstanding it would seem as tho I had in one
single act and for a moment departed from it, but I never did.</p>

<p>When I left <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1833">April 1833</date_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>there were determined
to have a state. As the <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>for those people it was my duty to
promote that determination but neither the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> nor
myself have ever in the least failed in our duty as <person_mentioned>Mexican Citizens
</person_mentioned>and there never has been any kind of design or plot to separate <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
from the <location_mentioned>Mexican republic</location_mentioned>. All the rumors and reports and 
suspicions that have been circulated about me and about the <person_mentioned>people of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> on this subject are uterly false and without the least 
foundation in truth</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. S. M. Williams</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I annex a copy of a letter received by <person_mentioned>Mr. G </person_mentioned>about a hour ago <hi rend="italic">in
great haste</hi></p>

<p>Yours <person_mentioned>Henry [Austin]</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. S. M. Williams</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>& <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Brazoria
Texas</location_mentioned></p>
