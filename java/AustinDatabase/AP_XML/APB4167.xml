*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p*[Saltillo] *date_mentioned n="03-12-1831">March 12, 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*This days mail brought me yours of *date_mentioned n="02-08-1831">Feb. 8*/date_mentioned* and *date_mentioned n="02-22-1831">22*/date_mentioned*. The course
adopted as to the *location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned*business accords with my views as you
have seen by my letter of *date_mentioned n="02-19-1831">19 Feb.*/date_mentioned* I then foresaw all this. You
say in the letter of*date_mentioned n="02-08-1831"> 8th*/date_mentioned* that you are going to *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned*, but as 
nothing is said on the subject in the one of *date_mentioned n="02-22-1831">22d.*/date_mentioned* I presume you did not go.
I should have regretted such a visit. No good could have resulted,
and some harm might, besides it would have been deviating from
the <hi rend="italic">spirit </hi>of the policy which has preserved us so far, that is to have
nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">extranious </hi>affairs, unless ordered especially by
Govt. If anything is said by my *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*in favor of one side, or the
other, it will be taken hold of to class us as belonging to one *person_mentioned*party*/person_mentioned*,
or the other. This will do an injury—we belong to the <hi rend="italic">law </hi>and to
the Govt and will obey when officially called on to do so.*/p*

*p*I have understood that *person_mentioned*Jorge [Fisher]*/person_mentioned* is publishing or has 
published a book, against me. He is a second *person_mentioned*Dayton */person_mentioned*and believes
that nothing was wanting but a *person_mentioned*leader */person_mentioned*among the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*to turn
them all against <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I fear the main object is to try and create
<hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*parties */person_mentioned*</hi>in the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*and by that means ruin us all. I have 
frequently said that, that *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*had not an *person_mentioned*enemy */person_mentioned*to fear except <hi rend="italic">itself</hi>,
if it remains united, and firm to me, NOTHING can touch it.*/p*

*p*I have written every mail since I have been here. The prospect
of another revolution in *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*is said to be getting more probable
every day. God preserve this unhappy and distracted *location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*. I
know not what is to become of them. If you keep united and 
harmonious in the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, you are better off and have more <hi rend="italic">Solid </hi>
guarantees for your rights, than any other part of this vast *location_mentioned*republic*/location_mentioned*, your
fate is in your own hands.*/p*

*p*Nothing need be expected from this *person_mentioned*Legislature*/person_mentioned*—our <hi rend="italic">iniciativa</hi>
relative to the *location_mentioned*ports of Matagorda and Galveston*/location_mentioned* was approved, and
afterwards hung up, by manoeuver, of a strange character. The 
feeling against *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*here is overwhelming, all I calculate on is to
pass away the time <hi rend="italic">quietly </hi>and of course silently and get back as
soon as I can.*/p*

*p*Remember that one of my contracts expires on *date_mentioned n="06-04-1831">4 of June*/date_mentioned*—have
all finished by *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*before then, for I assure you that nothing<barker_pb n="612"/>
can or will be done afterwards and perhaps a stopper will be applied
sooner owing to the hubbub between *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">B</hi>. [Bradburn]*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">M</hi>. [Madero]
*/person_mentioned*push this business if everything else is neglected.*/p*

*p*Keep a dead silence as to politics and *person_mentioned*public men*/person_mentioned*—read over my
letters by the two last mails more is meant there than is plainly 
expressed—also the one to *person_mentioned*Luke*/person_mentioned*. Don't form opinions about others
hastily by <hi rend="italic">appearances</hi>. I approve highly of what you said to
*person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">B</hi>[radburn?]*/person_mentioned* and*person_mentioned* <hi rend="italic">P</hi>[iedras?]*/person_mentioned*. Report says that *person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned* goes to
*location_mentioned*Bejar */location_mentioned*in all *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1831">this month*/date_mentioned*, it is also reported that his *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*is on the
way from *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*to acompany him. I know nothing of the truth of
these rumors. About 300 *person_mentioned*recruits */person_mentioned*passed here last week for *location_mentioned*Bejar*/location_mentioned*,
and more are expected*/p*

*p*(Send this paragraph in confidence to *person_mentioned*Judge Williams*/person_mentioned* with my
respects)—What the *person_mentioned*people on *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* ought to say, is that they
cannot and ought not to take any part in any quarrel between
any two *person_mentioned*officers */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*authorities*/person_mentioned*, unless officially called on to do so
by the competent *person_mentioned*superior authorities*/person_mentioned*. If they take sides, they
will in the end be kicked by <hi rend="italic">both sides</hi> as a person who intermeddles
in a quarrel between man and wife.*/p*

*p*I shall leave *person_mentioned*[George] Fisher*/person_mentioned* to the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, if the people there do not think that I merit their support, I will submit, for it will 
convince me that justice, honor, and gratitude, have abandoned the
earth.*/p*

*p*Don't neglect the *location_mentioned*reserves of land*/location_mentioned* I requested you in my last letter
to make.*/p*

*p*Request *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*not to name the *location_mentioned*town on colorado*/location_mentioned* untill I get
home.*/p*

*p*I send the *location_mentioned*grants */location_mentioned*that are made, I do not know whether any are
missing, but think that *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Goves </hi>[Jones?]*/person_mentioned* is, tho I am not certain if it
was sent for I have no list—you can say to those that are missing
if any, that they are not granted, and will not be, for the present
*person_mentioned*Govr */person_mentioned*will not grant any augmentations. I will try and get the
*person_mentioned*Mexican Domingues */person_mentioned*through but the others are <hi rend="italic">hopeless </hi>and you can
say so at once to the interested persons, so that they need not blame
me.*/p*

*p*We have had a very cold winter—three snows of 4 to 6 inches,
I have a bad cold and am in bad health. I fear that *person_mentioned*Chambers */person_mentioned*will
fail and if so he talks of not returning, I shall try to remove this
idea—he is a man who has many, very many good and valuable
qualities. I am more and more pleased with him every day, and hope
he will not abandon *location_mentioned*Tejas */location_mentioned*as he sometimes talks of doing—he has
taken up an erronious opinion about his standing there—he thinks
that the most of you in *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned* are his *person_mentioned*enemies*/person_mentioned*, and are jealous
of him,   I have told him that there is nothing of the kind now—he<barker_pb n="613"/>
complains that *person_mentioned*Luke */person_mentioned*did not answer his letters etc—he was milled
on his first arrival by the gabble of past years, and any stranger
would have been.*/p*

*p*On reflection I think it safest to send the *location_mentioned*grants */location_mentioned*by mail, I 
enclose the list of them I send this letter by *person_mentioned*Dn Fernando Rodrigues
*/person_mentioned*and at first intended to have sent the *location_mentioned*grants */location_mentioned*by him, but he would
mail them in *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*and the postage would be the same*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. A. */person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p*Let nothing be said in the *location_mentioned*paper */location_mentioned*about *person_mentioned*Arciniegas */person_mentioned*commission or
the issuing of titles—*person_mentioned*M's [Madero's] */person_mentioned*advertisement blew him up.
Remember me to *person_mentioned*Col Bradburn */person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">very </hi>particularly, say what you think
best in my name.*/p*
