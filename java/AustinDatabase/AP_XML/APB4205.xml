	<barker_summary>Bill to establish institute of modern languages, April 30, 1831. Organization
and curriculum.    (Omitted.)</barker_summary>
	<barker_footnotes>This date is somewhat arbitrary. Austin wrote Lucas Alaman, Sept. 20. 1830, that he intended while in the legislature next year to endeavor to get such a law passed. The legislature adjourned Apr. 30, 1831. The journals are not available to show the disposition of the bill, but it was not passed. Whether Austin actually presented it is uncertain. It would seem that Austin turned over to his colleague, Manuel Musquiz, " Cura de Morelos," the other representative of Texas, the task of framing the bill. This is
suggested by the ecclesiastical cast given to the organization, and by a copy of the bill
in a different hand with interlineations by Austin. Compare with a draft on the same
subject, Oct. 11, 1827.</barker_footnotes>
