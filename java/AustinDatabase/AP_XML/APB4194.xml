*p*Dr Sir,*/p*
*p*I am sorry to be compelled to trouble you with a few lines, but
necessity forces me to do it, I arrived with my own, and eight more
*person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*, on the *date_mentioned n="04-02-1831">2nd Inst,*/date_mentioned* at *location_mentioned*Harrisburgh*/location_mentioned*, at which place I learned
that, the *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*I had brought out *date_mentioned n="Fall-1830">Last fall*/date_mentioned* were ordered *location_mentioned*below
the St Antonio road,*/location_mentioned* and that they had all moved down, the most of
them to *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Mr. Milligan*/person_mentioned*'s*/location_mentioned*, I immediately went to *location_mentioned*St Phillippi,*/location_mentioned* to know
the particulars, while there, an order arrived, that all the *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*,
and myself, should return, to the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* I at first concluded to go
immediately, but all with whom I convers'd, at *location_mentioned*St Phillippi */location_mentioned*advised
me to wait, and pe[ti]tion for priviledge to remain in this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*,
and become a *person_mentioned*settler */person_mentioned*here, I have arranged all my business in
the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* and came with view to become a *person_mentioned*permanent residentor*/person_mentioned* in
this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and have sacrificed much, and underwent a great deal
of fatigue, and trouble, to get here, if we have to return, it will break
us all prety well.*/p*

*p*I anticipated no such difficulties, or I never should have engaged
in the business, but remain'd where I was well settled in *location_mentioned*Tennessee*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*As I believe it is in your power to do more with the government,
and with *person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned*, than any one else, and believing that you
are dispos'd to be friendly toward us, I now take the liberty to
request you, to intercede for us in any way your discretion, may
point out, and that as soon as you can, for I will not be able to
know what to do until I hear from you. If I am obliged to return
the sooner I know it the better, or if I am permitted to remain,
I wish to be trying to settle myself, if I can remain, I wish to settle
in the *location_mentioned*uper part of your colony*/location_mentioned**/p*.<barker_pb n="643"/>

*p*Any attention paid to my situation by you, will be greatfully
acknowledged, now is the time, sir, for you to do me, perhaps a
greater kindness, than you may ever have an opportunity to do me
again.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Alexr Thomson*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*N. B. until I hear my destiny, I expect to recide in the settlement
of *person_mentioned*Mr Milligan*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
