*p*My Dear Sir—*/p*

*p*I have at last safely arrived with my *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, after an unpleasant
and tedious passage. I am a good deal occupied endeavouring to
fix up some place to go in; and unfortunately am deprived of *person_mentioned*Mrs
Fisher*/person_mentioned*'s management, in consequence of a fall she received a day
or two Since. Could I possibly have left my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*I would have
gone up to See you as I am very anxious to have a conversation
with you. Since my arrival I have learned that our friend 
*person_mentioned*Lessassier */person_mentioned*has abandoned the practice of the Law, and turned *person_mentioned*teacher*/person_mentioned*.
Now *person_mentioned*school masters*/person_mentioned* are generally needy, and I hope I may not
experience delay or diffueulty in settling my business with him; he
must have collected a considerable sum on my account, and I am
already suffering for the means of Settling for my freight and
passage. I wrote to him to have it in readiness for me at *location_mentioned*Brazoria*/location_mentioned*,
and perhaps he may have, but as my letters were directed to *location_mentioned*San
Felipe */location_mentioned*the chances are he has not received them. I write you in
confidence that you may advise me. be good enough to write me
when you expect to go to *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*, and when you will return, 
enclosed is a letter from our friend *person_mentioned*Learning*/person_mentioned*. Present me to*person_mentioned* Mr.
Williams*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*and to my *person_mentioned*padrino*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S Rhoads Fisher*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Col. S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Enclosed is a letter to*person_mentioned* Mr. Lesassier */person_mentioned*which you will please deliver
to him, as it contains a request to send me immediately $300 by *person_mentioned*Mr
Jaques*/person_mentioned*, who will return the day after he reaches *location_mentioned*town*/location_mentioned*. Your 
suggestion to him of the inconvenience I am put to may probably
stimulate him to send it. *person_mentioned*Judge Cummins*/person_mentioned* has received a good deal
of money belonging to me, but has spent it, and says he cannot pay
me a dollar, this to say the least is ungenerous, as I paid for him
to the *person_mentioned*Sheriff */person_mentioned*last year between 2 and 300 drs.*/p*
