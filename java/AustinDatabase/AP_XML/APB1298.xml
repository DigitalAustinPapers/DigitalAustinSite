*p*Some time since I received a Summons in a cause between *person_mentioned*Thomas
Earle*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*N. Lynch*/person_mentioned*, from the hands of a *person_mentioned*Boy */person_mentioned*as a *person_mentioned*witness*/person_mentioned*, and
being on the Eve of going to the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*. I applied to the *person_mentioned*parties */person_mentioned*and
informed them that on this day I would give my Testimony of
what I knew respecting of what I knew in this suit.—The *person_mentioned*Alcalda*/person_mentioned*
did not appear according to appointment—This places me out of
the chance of sending my deposition or appearing, without 
considerable damage to myself.—I therefore transmit to you all I know
which I do not consider of importance in no way—Before *person_mentioned*Lynch*/person_mentioned*
started to *location_mentioned*N. Orleans*/location_mentioned* I handed him a one hundred note with a
Bill of articles that I wished him to bring me from that place he
told that he did not know whether he could carry the vessell (The
Augusta) into *location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*or not as there was a debt against her there,
but said, that he would leave the vessell and go to *location_mentioned*Orleans*/location_mentioned*, and if,
the debt stood there against her, he would endeavor to get some
craft to bring such articles to the schooner; and not go with the
vessell into that *location_mentioned*port*/location_mentioned*, on this conversation he took the note and
bill, and observed to me, if the vessell should unavoidably be seised
in the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* (which he would not allow if it was possible to avoid)
if he might make use of a part of this money to endeavor to get
her or some other vessell to return to this *location_mentioned*bay*/location_mentioned*, I told him that
he might—This is all I know I am willing to be Qualified to this
statement and should have been if the *person_mentioned*alcalda */person_mentioned*had appeared*person_mentioned*—N
Lynch*/person_mentioned* has paid me the ballance on his return over the articles I
sent for—*/p*
