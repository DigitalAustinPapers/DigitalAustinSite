*p*My Dear Sir*/p*

have merited, I determined that you should at least hear from me<barker_pb n="629"/>
in acknowledgement of the receipt of your favours, even tho I be
unable to make mine interesting.*/p*

*p*I do most perfectly coincide with you in your opinions respecting
the policy and the probable results of the death of *person_mentioned*Guerrero */person_mentioned*and

novelty.*/p*

*date_mentioned n="11-13-1831">13th Novr*/date_mentioned* as I have forwarded to you several numbers, nevertheless
a part of the failure has arrisen from a suspension of the paper for
want of materials. You will perceive by the numbers that go by
this mail that a change has been made, and I assure you that it is
an important one. and must prove beneficial to the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*
