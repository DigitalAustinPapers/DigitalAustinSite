<p>Sir,</p>

<p>As <person_mentioned>Chief Magistrate of this <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, I take the liberty to address
you upon a subject of Deep interest to many of our <person_mentioned>Citizens</person_mentioned>. It
has been represented to me from a source that may be relied on, that
a number of <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned> and horses of the <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned> residing near the
<location_mentioned>Sabine</location_mentioned>, in the <location_mentioned>Western section of the State</location_mentioned>, have been stolen and
carried into the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, by a lawless <person_mentioned>banditti</person_mentioned> associated
for the purpose; and that many Dishonest <person_mentioned>Debtors</person_mentioned>, who fly from
justice here, taking with them in some instances, property mortgaged
for the payment of their Debts, take refuge in the said <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned>.
Indeed, I am informed that property mortgaged here for a large
amount has been thus carried off.</p>

<p>Relying upon your high character, the people feel assured that
you will cheerfully do all in your power to prevent the recurrence
of the evils complained of. I should feel much gratified, Sir, to
learn for the information of those interested, what steps should be
adopted, best calculated to put a stop to such outrages, and for the
recovery of the Debts alluded to.</p>

<p>Connected as your <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned> is with this <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>, it is important to
both, that harmony should prevail, and that a friendly intercourse
should be carried between them. So far as may depend upon the
exercise of my authority, the object shall be effected.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>H. Johnson</person_mentioned> [Governor of Louisana.]</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. Stephen A. [sic] Austin</person_mentioned></p>
