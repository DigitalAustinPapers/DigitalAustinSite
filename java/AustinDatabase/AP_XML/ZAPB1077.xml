<p>My Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I received your short epistle some time since giving me the pleasing
news of your safe arrival at <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned> I had become extremely anxious
for you, the letters that you wrote from the <location_mentioned>diferant towns on the
River</location_mentioned>, for some cause or other were a great while coming to hand
I received a letter from My Dear <person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned> dated in <date_mentioned n="12-xx-1825">December</date_mentioned> which
gave me much more satisfaction, and pleasure, than the one received
by <person_mentioned>Mr. Hale</person_mentioned> in his last he appears to be reconciled and pleased with
my choice of a <person_mentioned>companion</person_mentioned>; and I have not the least doubt but when
he comes to know <person_mentioned>Mr. Perry</person_mentioned> better that he will approve of my
choice still more<barker_pb n="1073"/></p>

<p>Your <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned> are all well, as far as I know. <person_mentioned>Uncle Austin's
family</person_mentioned> still remain as they were when you left this, nothing is done
towards closing the <location_mentioned>estate </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Moses</person_mentioned> lives at the place, and has the four
<person_mentioned>boys </person_mentioned>with him, and<person_mentioned> Eliza</person_mentioned> the girls, <person_mentioned>Margaret</person_mentioned> has never return'd to
live with <person_mentioned>Mrs. S. Perry</person_mentioned> neather do I know weather they intend to
let her, poor <person_mentioned>Girls </person_mentioned>through the foolish pride of their elder <person_mentioned>sister</person_mentioned>
they are prevented from receiving many advantages that they other
wise would have—<person_mentioned> William</person_mentioned> has got into some kind of business in
<location_mentioned>Georga</location_mentioned> that brings him in three hundred Dollars a year—and is
not expected in this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>for two or three years— <person_mentioned>Cousin

sattisfy every clame that is against him, and I trust it will not be
long before he will be able to realize as much Money as will set him

him for all the fatigue boath of body and mine, that he has suffered
for the Last six years. O it will be a most joyful period to me, when
