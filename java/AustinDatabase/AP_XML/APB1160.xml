*div1 type="body"*

*p*In compliance with your *person_mentioned*Lordship*/person_mentioned*'s communication of the *date_mentioned n="05-01-1826">1st
Instant*/date_mentioned*, in which you direct me to report to you any incidents, civil
or military occurring in this *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*worthy of the notice of the
government, I have the honor to enclose copies of my 
communications to the *person_mentioned*Military Commander of Texas*/person_mentioned*, relative to the late
occurrences with the *person_mentioned*Tahuacano */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Waco Indians,*/person_mentioned* and the 
movements of the *person_mentioned*Militia*/person_mentioned*. I did not communicate these matters to the
civil government at an earlier period, because they were purely
military; and, having received all my orders on the subject from
the *person_mentioned*Military Commander*/person_mentioned*, I was led to the conclusion that it was
my duty to acquaint the government with military transactions
through that *person_mentioned*officer*/person_mentioned*, and that I could irrespectively report to the
*person_mentioned*Civil */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*Military Chief*/person_mentioned*, both being, in their respective spheres,
agents of the Supreme Government. I find myself mistaken, and
pray your *person_mentioned*Lordship*/person_mentioned* to receive this explanation as an apology if I
have in any manner failed in the discharge of my duty. 
Henceforth I shall communicate with you, as well as with the *person_mentioned*Military
Commander*/person_mentioned*, in all military matters.*/p*

*p*The attack upon the *person_mentioned*Tankuas */person_mentioned*which you direct me to report to
you, took place on the *date_mentioned n="03-25-1826">25th of March*/date_mentioned*, on the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, about *location_mentioned*eight<barker_pb n="1342"/>
leagues below the Atascosito road.*/location_mentioned* These *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were encamped
on the very same spot, where, some months previous, they had
stolen from the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*twenty odd hogs, and a large quantity of
corn. A small party of the *person_mentioned*neighbors */person_mentioned*went to the *person_mentioned*Indians' */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*
to arrest the *person_mentioned*thieves*/person_mentioned*; the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*presented their arms and refused
to give up the guilty *person_mentioned*persons*/person_mentioned*. Those who had lost the property
came to me with their complaints. I sent for the *person_mentioned*Chief Carita*/person_mentioned*, and
the *person_mentioned*Tankua Chief*/person_mentioned*, and told them they must keep out of the 
*location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*and deliver up the *person_mentioned*thieves */person_mentioned*for punishment by flogging, 
otherwise they should be shot; after this understanding they withdrew
from the *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*. This took place about eighteen months since.
In the mean time the *person_mentioned*Chief Carita*/person_mentioned* died, and during the month of
*date_mentioned n="03-xx-1826">March*/date_mentioned* his *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*came down to the *location_mentioned*Colorado */location_mentioned*where the hogs had been
stolen, which made the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*residing there believe that they 
intended a renewal of their former robberies; and, unfortunately,
some fat hogs being missed at the same time, they suspected the
*person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*of killing them. This, together with the robberies of the
previous year, excited the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*, who immediately assembled to go
to the *location_mentioned*villages */location_mentioned*and ascertain the fact. The *person_mentioned*Militia Officer*/person_mentioned* in that
part of the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*is a very young man, and he refused to take 
command of the *person_mentioned*party*/person_mentioned*, upon which they elected one of their number to
lead them. On their arrival at one of the *location_mentioned*villages*/location_mentioned*, two or three of
the *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*commenced firing; their example was followed by six others,
before they could be prevented by their *person_mentioned*commander */person_mentioned*giving, as an
excuse for their attack, that the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were levelling their arms.
Two of the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were killed and four wounded, as I since learned;
and one of the *person_mentioned*American party */person_mentioned*who had lost his way in the *location_mentioned*woods*/location_mentioned*
was *person_mentioned*killed*/person_mentioned*. So soon as I was informed of the fact, I made inquiry
into it, and, from my investigations, I felt satisfied that the presumed
depredations of the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*were not sufficiently established to justify
the attack, although there were good reasons to suspect them. I lost
no time in calling the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*together; they arrived here on the
*date_mentioned n="04-29-1826">29th of April*/date_mentioned* and remained *date_mentioned n="05-04-1826">four days*/date_mentioned*. After having had a talk
with them, they declared themselves fully satisfied, and withdrew,
with the understanding that any of their *person_mentioned*tribe */person_mentioned*who should hereafter
steal anything from our *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*should be surrendered for 
punishment; and, that, on their failing to do so, the *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*would be shot
wherever he was found.*/p*

*p*This is the plain history of the whole affair and it will be necessary
to compel*person_mentioned* those who made the attack */person_mentioned*to pay the expenses incurred by
calling the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*together, there not having been sufficient 
provocation to justify the attack that was made upon them. In the early
part of *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1826">March */date_mentioned*five *person_mentioned*Choctaws */person_mentioned*killed some of the *person_mentioned*Tankuas */person_mentioned*I promised
to interpose as peace maker between them.*/p*<barker_pb n="1343"/>

*p*The accompanying copies of my communications to the *person_mentioned*Military
Commander*/person_mentioned* will apprize your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*of the news relative to the
*person_mentioned*Tahuacanoes*/person_mentioned*, and of my consequent dispositions. I consider it
highly important that your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*Military Commander
*/person_mentioned*should write to the *person_mentioned*Cherokees*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Alabamas */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Cushates*/person_mentioned*, and to the
*person_mentioned*Alcaldes */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Captains of the Militia*/person_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*and the *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned*,
to join us in the contemplated war.*/p*

*p*After *person_mentioned*Captain Boss*/person_mentioned*' encounter with the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*on the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*,
I ordered a small log *location_mentioned*fortification */location_mentioned*to be erected there, for the 
protection of the *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*in case of an invasion: the people of that
section went to work very industriously and it is completed. I shall
order other works of a similar character to be erected at the 
*location_mentioned*crossing on the Brazosof the road to Bexar*/location_mentioned*, and probably here, provided
the war is continued for any length of time, as we are all determined
to defend ourselves and the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*even if the whole *person_mentioned*Comanche*/person_mentioned*
nation come upon us. If the *person_mentioned*government */person_mentioned*can supply us with 
ammunition, 150 escopets, 150 pistols, and 150 sabres it will be an important
addition, also six cannon of small caliber two for Each *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned**/p*.

*p*Relative to colonization the business of the *location_mentioned*first Colony*/location_mentioned* has not
been completed, owing to the protracted absence of the 
*person_mentioned*Commissioner */person_mentioned*; there are some complaints about it, and difficulties are likely
to arise. This reason, and the fact that sothing as yet has been done
towards the commencement of the *location_mentioned*new Colony*/location_mentioned*, has caused the 
*person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*to petition me not to take the field and expose my person
until their business is settled; which induced me not to take 
command of the party who were sent out to protect the *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Respecting the administration of justice, we had, on the 1st 
Instant, a suit which lasted seven days. The plaintiff was *person_mentioned*Imla Keep*/person_mentioned*
and the defendant *person_mentioned*Jared E. Groce*/person_mentioned*. The case being important I called
together twelve good *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*residents */person_mentioned*of the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, as *person_mentioned*Jurymen*/person_mentioned*, to
hear the evidence and decide upon it, and after a laborious 
examination of several *person_mentioned*witnesses */person_mentioned*for both *person_mentioned*parties*/person_mentioned*, the decision of eleven of
the *person_mentioned*jurymen */person_mentioned*was in favor of the *person_mentioned*plaintiff*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Imla Keep*/person_mentioned*, and I approved
their verdict. The defendant, *person_mentioned*Groce*/person_mentioned* was much dissatisfied, and he
will, probably, appeal to the government. The affair that occurred
between him and the *person_mentioned*Administrator Don Juan Veramendi*/person_mentioned* at *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*,
will give your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*an idea of his character*/p*.

*p*The people in this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, are now, more satisfied and united, live
in greater harmony and display more industry than they have ever
done before from its commencement.*/p*

*p*I request your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*to take into consideration my proposals
to the *person_mentioned*Military Commander*/person_mentioned* in relation to the *person_mentioned*Cherokee*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Cushates*/person_mentioned*,
and *person_mentioned*Alabamas*/person_mentioned*, and the *person_mentioned*Militia of *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*and the *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*.    If
you approve them, I beg you will send me letters addressed to those<barker_pb n="1344"/>
*person_mentioned*parties*/person_mentioned*, and that you will also send instructions to the *person_mentioned*Cherokees */person_mentioned*
relative to the thieving *person_mentioned*tribes */person_mentioned*in their vicinity; giving them orders not
to make war upon the *person_mentioned*Tankuas*/person_mentioned*, on whom, they have written to me,
it is their intention to avenge the death of some of their *person_mentioned*warriors*/person_mentioned*
who were killed three years since. It would also be advisable to write
to the *person_mentioned*Cushates */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*of *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*to tell the *person_mentioned*Cherokees*/person_mentioned*
they must not carry on hostilities against the *person_mentioned*Tankuas*/person_mentioned*, as that tribe
is at peace with the *person_mentioned*Mexicans*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The foregoing is in answer to your *person_mentioned*Lordship*/person_mentioned*'s communication of
the *date_mentioned n="05-01-1826">1st Instant*/date_mentioned*.*/p*
