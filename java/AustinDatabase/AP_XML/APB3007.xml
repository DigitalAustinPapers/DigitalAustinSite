*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*There is likely to be some difficulty between *person_mentioned*William Milican*/person_mentioned* and
*person_mentioned*Whitesides boys*/person_mentioned* I will Explain the circumstances to you and wish
your opinion   *person_mentioned*Henry and Boland Whitesides*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Jack C. Davis*/person_mentioned*<barker_pb n="1212"/>applied to me Jointly for Land I agreed to let them have the League
of Land to be Equally divided but when *person_mentioned*Sims*/person_mentioned* made his Return he
left out the name of *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* and the Deed came out in the name of
*person_mentioned*Henry and Boland Whiteside*/person_mentioned* of which I Informed them when I
delivered to them the deed they agreed it should make no difference
that they wood secure to *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned**location_mentioned* one Third of said League of Land*/location_mentioned* as
Soon as It was convenient *person_mentioned*Mr. Milican*/person_mentioned* has now bot one Third
of the Land from *person_mentioned*Henry Whiteside*/person_mentioned* and has taken his obligation to
make him a Deed to It he has also bot *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* land which constitutes
another Third they made a Division of the Land as appears from
the manner in which they have disposed of It. this is the only
Evidence of, a Division *person_mentioned*Boland Whiteside*/person_mentioned* now contends for One
Half of the League of Land and says that as no Legal Division has
been made he is not bound to be governed by the sales that were
made he further contends that *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* has no Right to the Land
that he has got the Deed and will hold the Land Now the question
is wheather *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* Sale of the Land wood Intitle *person_mentioned*Mr. Milican*/person_mentioned* to It
or not or wheather *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* could hold the Land himself Independant
of *person_mentioned*Boland*/person_mentioned*s opposition and wheather the Division made among them
previous to *person_mentioned*Mr. Milican*/person_mentioned*s purchasing this Land wood be considered
obligatory or Legal *person_mentioned*Mr Milican*/person_mentioned* on faith of the Contract made
with *person_mentioned*Davis*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Henry Whiteside*/person_mentioned* has moved on to the Land with
his *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*your opinion on the subject might Enable me to have
the matter arranged without any further difficulty or otherwise the
Business will come before you for Decission*/p*
