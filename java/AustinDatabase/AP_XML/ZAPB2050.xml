<p><person_mentioned>Col. Austin</person_mentioned> Dr sir.</p>

<p>The<person_mentioned> Bearer Mr. Francis Keller</person_mentioned> a respectable citizen of this <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>,
visits your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>with a view to make a permanent settlement for
himself and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, if he should be pleased with the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Keller</person_mentioned> has resided at <location_mentioned>Woodville </location_mentioned>for the last 10 or 12 years—
and justly merits the character he sustains—of an honest industrious
citizen—Should he be able to procure lands in your settlement—on
the <location_mentioned>Brassos</location_mentioned>—he intends removing with his <location_mentioned>family </location_mentioned>and property and
connections soon enough to make a crop <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1826">next year</date_mentioned>. His force will
be no inconsiderable acquisition to the agricultural interests of the
<location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mr. Keller</person_mentioned> is a countryman of the <person_mentioned>Baron de Bastrop</person_mentioned>—I
think you may afford to grant him a choice reserve— on account
of the strength and capital he will add to the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Remember me to your <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>—and tell him there will be a plenty
of <person_mentioned>plump girls</person_mentioned>— in the <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Arms of God—los Brassos de Dios</location_mentioned></hi> [The
Brazos River] by <date_mentioned n="Spring - 1826"> next spring</date_mentioned>. I see most of the respectable 
<person_mentioned>travelers </person_mentioned>who are passing to the <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned></hi>both as they go out and return—
They for the most part come back highly pleased—<person_mentioned>Teizer</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Wood</person_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>Hurd Thompson</person_mentioned> &c are delighted with the soil and climate—as well
as the growing prospects—hastening the future importance of these
delightful regions.</p>

<p>God preserve you 1,000 years</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J. Child</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I wish I was out of this sickly country, and well settled among
you</p>
