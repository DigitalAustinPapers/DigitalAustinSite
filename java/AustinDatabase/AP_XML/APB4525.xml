*p*Dear *person_mentioned*Col*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Patrick Green*/person_mentioned*, who you will recollect has been in the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*
four or five years, and thro' ignorance and poverty has failed to<barker_pb n="925"/>
procure a better location of land than can now be made, appealed
to me to assist him in getting him a donation, and in clearing it out
of the *location_mentioned*office*/location_mentioned*. I therefore entered his name on *location_mentioned*a league next to
*person_mentioned*Grayson*/person_mentioned*s on the Caronkoway*/location_mentioned*, which he now visits *location_mentioned*San Felipe */location_mentioned*to
obtain a title to. I promised also to furnish him with the means of
payment which I had with me when I was in *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned* last, for
that purpose; but am at this time without. You will please have
the goodness to let this form no obstruction to the issuing of the
title, as I have assured*person_mentioned* Mr. G------*/person_mentioned*it should not, and I will forward
the money in two or three weeks, or make payment when I shall be
in *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned* in the course of the month. I will send you the
Spanish Copy of the remonstrance next week, as correctly printed
as we have the means of doing, for I am afraid it will not do to
wait longer for corrections—without losing much of the effect its
circulation will have.*/p*

*p*Let me hear from you as to the present aspect of our political
arrangements.*/p*
