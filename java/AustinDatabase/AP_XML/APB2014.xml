*p*My Dear *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I receivd your welcome letter under date of *date_mentioned n="04-10-1825">10th of April*/date_mentioned*, while on
a visit to this place and hasten to answer it, before I leave <hi rend="italic">this</hi>;
as opportunities more frequently occur from here, than *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*Not long since I wrote you; and *person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*at the same time 
forwarded an answer to*person_mentioned* Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned*'s letter, which no doubt you will
receive in due time— You mention that a letter from *person_mentioned*Stephen */person_mentioned*dated
in *date_mentioned n="12-xx-1824">Decemr. last*/date_mentioned* which you received, gave you more Satisfaction
(with respect to his reconciliation, of your choice of a *person_mentioned*partner*/person_mentioned*) than
any before received, on that subject. Let me assure you My <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>
<hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Sister */person_mentioned*</hi>that he is not only reconciled but pleased, much pleased, with
your Choice—knowing as <hi rend="italic">he </hi>does, that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>would not take so impor-<barker_pb n="1114"/>
tant a step without consulting <hi rend="italic">your happiness</hi>; The only objects dear
to us on this Earth being yourself and lovely <hi rend="italic">little </hi>*person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, rest assured
whenever you are happy we shall be perfectly so—Our *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*
seems to think, owing to the yet infant state of the *location_mentioned*Settlement */location_mentioned*that
it would not be altogether advisable, for *person_mentioned*Mr. P. */person_mentioned*to remove to this
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, at present—there is nothing he could do, that would be
advantageous to him, for some years to come—tho I hope the 
*location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*will so far improve in the course [of] a very [few] years, that
it will attract the attention of *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned*—and be so much to his
interest that he will be induced to relinquish the <hi rend="italic">cold </hi>and unfriendly
Climate of *location_mentioned*Mo.*/location_mentioned* for the more mild and salubrious one of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, where
I think the mildness of the Climate tends in some degree to Soften
the feelings of <hi rend="italic">Man </hi>and render him more like a natural <hi rend="italic">Being</hi>—
Indeed my dear *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*it certainly, will be <hi rend="italic">" the most joyful period
of our lives" </hi>when we can embrace our *person_mentioned*Sister */person_mentioned*with " peace and
plenty " smiling around us after the many vicissitudes we have passed
through for the last Six years—The time is not far distant, if our
lives are spared, when the fond <hi rend="italic">vision </hi>will be realized.*/p*

*p*I am happy to hear *person_mentioned*Cousin Adeline*/person_mentioned* has changed the name of
*person_mentioned*Bates */person_mentioned*for that of *person_mentioned*Lewis*/person_mentioned*, and also that she has so soon commenced
housekeeping, may her life be long—prosperous and happy—and
may<hi rend="italic"> " misfortune not mark her for her one."</hi> You will greet her
with a kiss for me when you meet her—You were " pleased and 
provoked " at my <hi rend="italic">brevity </hi>in one of my last letters, and think that I can
never be at a loss for a subject when writing to my *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned*—You will
please to excuse that letter and I will try and be more prolix in future.
I must have been in one of my <hi rend="italic">Lazy Moods</hi> when I wrote—*person_mentioned*Stephen*/person_mentioned*
has not gone to the *location_mentioned*City of Saltillo*/location_mentioned*, probably he will not go untill
*date_mentioned n="Fall-1825">fall*/date_mentioned*, as he is fully determined to close the affairs of the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*
before he makes his return to *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, he can obtain the settling of
<hi rend="italic">500 </hi>or <hi rend="italic">600 </hi>*person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*more, by making application—Everything goes
on finely; not withstanding the unfavorable season we have had,
good crops will be made— <hi rend="italic">The *person_mentioned*Priest*/person_mentioned*</hi> will be on in a few days to
organize a *location_mentioned*church */location_mentioned*and attend to our spiritual affairs—Draw no 
conclusions from the date of my letter I am merely on a visit of a few
days, because I pass my time so heavy at *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*—and also, because
it is a pleasure to visit a *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*I esteem so highly as I do this.
Present my respects to *person_mentioned*Brother James*/person_mentioned*—and kiss my charming <hi rend="italic">little
*person_mentioned*niece*/person_mentioned*</hi>, tell the *person_mentioned*Boys */person_mentioned*to study hard, and *person_mentioned*uncle */person_mentioned*will not forget any of
them *person_mentioned*Brother */person_mentioned*sends his love Your Affectionate Brother*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Jas. E. B. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*
