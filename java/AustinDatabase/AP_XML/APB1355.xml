*p*Dr sir*/p*

*p*I am happy to hear of your return and hope your visit to 
*location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*has, and will result in much good to the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*We have lately had 2 visits to our *location_mentioned*station */location_mentioned*of the *person_mentioned*Coronkawases*/person_mentioned*;
the first part had six, and the [second] twelve in number, they
professed great friendship to us and actually had it in their power
to have killed several of our *person_mentioned*people*/person_mentioned*, as they came *location_mentioned*up to the station*/location_mentioned*;
for they found one *person_mentioned*man */person_mentioned*and 2 *person_mentioned*boys */person_mentioned**location_mentioned*10 miles below here*/location_mentioned* at work,
and actually were in their *location_mentioned*camp */location_mentioned*in a manner—before they were 
discovered;*location_mentioned* a few miles above that*/location_mentioned* they came to another labor in like
manner where there were a *person_mentioned*man */person_mentioned*and a *person_mentioned*woman*/person_mentioned*; and hurt no one but
I am of opinion that they are only waiting a good opportunity to
make a break on our *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, therefore we are constantly upon
our Guard; and so soon as we get our corn planted we will try to be
ready for them, and are determined that they must not come amongst
us—for since we have heard of the late murders in your *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*it
is more than *person_mentioned*Americans */person_mentioned*can hear to suffer them to come under the
coulor of friendship when their hands are yet reeking with the blood
of Inosent *person_mentioned*women */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*; and as we expect a campaign against
them from your *location_mentioned*quarter*/location_mentioned*, I have thought it most advisable to keep
peace with them if possible untill that time; and being advised of<barker_pb n="1625"/>
the time we can have it in our power to know where they are and
can give you 15 or 20 good brave *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*to assist in cuting them entirely
off. and If a Campaign is intended please to let me know that I
may know how to act.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Kerr*/person_mentioned* is at *location_mentioned*la Bahia*/location_mentioned*, but looked for every hour. I had news
from *location_mentioned*Gonzales */location_mentioned*yesterday 2 *location_mentioned*Blockhouses */location_mentioned*are well built and now
under the Command of *person_mentioned*Mr. Byrd Lockhart*/person_mentioned*; all are in peace at that
place; and no *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*sign near that is known of.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr Monchola*/person_mentioned* has not sent the ballance of my guns to me and the
*person_mentioned*individuals */person_mentioned*who own them, altho he has been ordered to do so and
it is greatly to the hurt of the *person_mentioned*owners */person_mentioned*as they want them to hunt
their meat as well as to guard themselves with.*/p*

*p*Please write me and give me the news, as *person_mentioned*Mr Kerr*/person_mentioned* and myself
are both anxious to hear from the *location_mentioned*N Eastward*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*S westward,*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

against the *person_mentioned*Corronks*/person_mentioned*, that we may have time to prepare to Join you—¦*/p*
