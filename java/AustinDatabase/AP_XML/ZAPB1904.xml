<p>Dr Sir <person_mentioned>Mr. Saml Williams</person_mentioned> has never yet sent the papers for
the Sloop althoug[h] I have written him at two different times
since he left this <location_mentioned>place </location_mentioned>to send them down and if no safe 
opportunity offered to hire some <person_mentioned>person </person_mentioned>to come down that there might
be no disapointment the Sloop left this <date_mentioned n="04-10-1830">five days ago</date_mentioned> and has been
laying at the <location_mentioned>mouth of the River</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="04-12-1830">two or three days</date_mentioned> with a fair wind
but could not proceed for want of papers four days since we 
dispatched a <person_mentioned>messenger </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> who ought to have returned
<date_mentioned n="04-14-1830">yesterday </date_mentioned>by 12 oClock he has not yet come I think <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>
has detained him, it is a verry serious injury to us the season is far
advanced and our Corn is somewhat injured and it is all important
that we should get it to market imediately; I do not know <person_mentioned>Mr
Williams</person_mentioned> reasons for treating us so unfriendly when he has 
received favours from our concern and never has yet been denied, if
our buisness could have been done at another place I then would
not have thought so hard of <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>but he knowing that we were
dependent on him for the papers he ought to have given more 
attention to it,</p>
