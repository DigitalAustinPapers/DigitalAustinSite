*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I recd yours giving a transcript of the opinion of the *person_mentioned*lawyers */person_mentioned*
relative to the *location_mentioned*Mine a Burton*/location_mentioned* property, and it appearing that the 
prospect of recovering any thing is so remote and uncertain it probably
would cost more than it is worth to attempt it—at all events I can
not attend to it— *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*mentioned in one of her letters that you
both had an idea of removing from the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*to some place and
spoke of *location_mentioned*Arkansas*/location_mentioned*— If you close your business so as to leave the
*location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*I hope you will not settle any where untill you have first
visited this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*I have not the least doubt that you will make
a fortune if you come here, but of that you must judge for yourself,
and to do so you must visit the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, and I shall expect you in
*date_mentioned n="10-xx-1827">October */date_mentioned*next without fail— One month will bring you here by
land through *location_mentioned*Arkansas*/location_mentioned*, one month here to look round, and one to
return is three months, and about three hundred dollars expence—
and you will see the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*generally from *location_mentioned*Potosi */location_mentioned*to this place—*/p*

*p*Our State Constitution is to be published in this place on the *date_mentioned n="05-29-1827">29
of this month*/date_mentioned* and*date_mentioned n="11-29-1827"> Six months after that day*/date_mentioned* the introduction of
*person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*is prohibited. No one can be born to slavery *location_mentioned*within the state
*/location_mentioned*after its publication   It will be a great speculation to bring in *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*<barker_pb n="1646"/>
before the time expires for as no more can be introduced those who
are here in time will sell or hire very high Every thing you may
have seen in the *location_mentioned*news papers*/location_mentioned* relative to *person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*being taken away
from the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*and freed is all false—the *person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*in the country—
within six months after the constitution is published will be *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*
for life—*/p*

*p*If you ever think of coming to look at this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*now is the time.
I had reserved some *location_mentioned*choice tracts of land*/location_mentioned* with a hope that you might
have come out before, but there is still land enough and of first rate
quality and well situated to be had.*/p*

*p*The best time of the year to move here is in the fall so as to reach
here in *date_mentioned n="10-xx-1827">October*/date_mentioned*, If you do not wish to go through *location_mentioned*Arkansas */location_mentioned*the
best way to come next *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1827">fall */date_mentioned*to look at us is in a Steam boat to 
*location_mentioned*Alexandria*/location_mentioned*, and thence on horse back to this place, the road from there
out is good and settled all the way except 50 miles at one place
the distance from *location_mentioned*Alexandria */location_mentioned*out is about 300 miles*/p*

*p*Our prospects are very good as to crops, emigration, peace, 
government etc etc. The state constitution is a very good one you
may set down every thing you see in the *location_mentioned*news papers*/location_mentioned* unfavourable
to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*as false,*/p*

*p*remember me particularly to*person_mentioned* S. Perry*/person_mentioned*, and to *person_mentioned*John P—*/person_mentioned*and his
*person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and to all my old acquaintances—and kiss the *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*for me—
Love to *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*this letter is written to both of you—*/p*
