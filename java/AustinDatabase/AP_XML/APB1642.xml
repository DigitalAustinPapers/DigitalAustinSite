*p**date_mentioned n="11-24-1828">Nov 24 1828*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have again been compelled to abandon my place *location_mentioned*above the La
Bahia road*/location_mentioned*, much against my will I do assure You,    So long as
the *location_mentioned*upper Settlement*/location_mentioned* maintained their ground I did not dispair<barker_pb n="145"/>
being able to complete my *location_mentioned*mills*/location_mentioned*; but after being deserted by my
*person_mentioned*neighbors */person_mentioned*I deemed it useless, and perhaps unsafe, to remain there
any longer;—however, I do not dispair of returning in a short
time—nothing within my power shall be wanting to reestablish a
*location_mentioned*Settlement */location_mentioned*at that place;—For this purpose I shall make such 
proposals to those who wish to Settle *location_mentioned*in that part of the colony */location_mentioned*as
cannot fail being accepted by all who wish well to the country *location_mentioned*half
my land at that place*/location_mentioned* will I give, if necessary, to effect this desirable
object—could the *person_mentioned*uper settlers*/person_mentioned* view the importance of maintaining
that place in the same light that I do, I am sure they would be less
captious and hard to please than I am afraid will be found to be
the case—If that *location_mentioned*settlement */location_mentioned*is suffered to break up and disperse it
will be a misfortune to the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*that many years may not be able
to retrieve— The late visits of the *person_mentioned*Comanchas */person_mentioned*must be ascribed
to the misconduct and imprudence of some of the *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*
themselves, who for the sake of a little base dishonest self interest would
sink the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*in irretrieveable ruin—If some means could be
devised to keep the *person_mentioned*Tonkuays */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Lapans */person_mentioned*from coming among us,
it is probable we should not be troubled with the *person_mentioned*Comanchas*/person_mentioned*
unless they wish to commence unprovoked hostilities against us,—
*person_mentioned*Two Indians of the Shawneys tribe*/person_mentioned* came to my place more than
*date_mentioned n="10-xx-1828">a month ago*/date_mentioned*, stayed with me several days and then started *location_mentioned*up the
river */location_mentioned*to explore the *location_mentioned*country of the San Sabo*/location_mentioned*—They have not 
returned at the time they appointed, which was last *date_mentioned n="11-19-1828">Wednesday*/date_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*Considering the punctuality of *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*in keeping such 
appointments I think it very probable that they have been killed by the
*person_mentioned*Comanchas*/person_mentioned*, as they are now in the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*through which they
were to travel— These *person_mentioned*Shawneys */person_mentioned*had traveled a great deal through
the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* were *person_mentioned*men of considerable intelligence*/person_mentioned*, and must have had
a good deal of influence with their *person_mentioned*nation*/person_mentioned*— They said that if
they liked the *location_mentioned*upper country*/location_mentioned* their people would commence settling
*location_mentioned*35 or 40 miles above the San Antonio road*/location_mentioned* within three months
after their return—they left 58 deer skins, a little ammunition and
some other *person_mentioned*Indian */person_mentioned*trinkets with me—I have brought them away
and will leave them with*person_mentioned* Mr. Newman
