*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*This will be delivered to you by *person_mentioned*Coll Milam*/person_mentioned* who is empowered
by me to settle with you relative to all concerns of cash and land
now pending between us Although your silence equivalent to a
refusal to enter into the engagements which I had made in *location_mentioned*England*/location_mentioned*
agreably to your own request and even sooner than you could
have anticipated (since it was fully understood indeed even common
reason proves that previously to forming a contract the Documents
which proved your having possession of the *location_mentioned*lands */location_mentioned*were to be forwarded to me in *location_mentioned*London*/location_mentioned*) compromised me most seriously and injured my interests more than I can describe, and you not having
returned more than one very short answer to my numerous letters
has amazed me it will be your fault if we do not meet hereafter
on the same terms we hitherto have and you will I trust at hart
allow that I have not been a bad *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*towards you—*person_mentioned*Milam*/person_mentioned* will
write to me constantly and I shall be happy to hear from you—You
will I hope come to a settlement with him as speedily as is possible
since he is anxious to get on to the *location_mentioned*Ud. States*/location_mentioned* and will remain with <barker_pb n="1258"/>
you only one or two days on my account—   wishing you health and
success I remain very truly yours*/p*
