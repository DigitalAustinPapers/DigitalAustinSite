*p*D. Sir*/p*

*p*I crossed the *location_mentioned*Sabine */location_mentioned*on the *date_mentioned n="06-01-1828">first day of June*/date_mentioned* and the season being
so far advanced the *location_mentioned*roads */location_mentioned*so bad, and corn so scarce and high, that
I was compelld to decline proceeding into the *location_mentioned*province */location_mentioned*further than<barker_pb n="69"/>
this place with my *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, untill I take a ride through and view
the different parts of the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*and make my selection for a 
permanent *location_mentioned*Settlement*/location_mentioned**/p*.

*p*I have just received your message by *person_mentioned*Majr M. A. Heard*/person_mentioned* and
intend to visit you as soon as I possibly can, after making the
necessary provisions for the comfort of my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*during this
season as they will have to remain in this place until I explore,
select a situation and provide the necessary buildings for their
comfort—my wish and intention is to try to procure a good healthy
situation as *location_mentioned*near the Gulf*/location_mentioned* as I can find such an one and as near the
scite as possible that will most probably be the *location_mentioned*principal seaport of
the Country,*/location_mentioned* and I shall wish your advice and assistance in making
such selections so far as you can give them to me without too much
trouble and inconvenience to yourself. I believe that you have a
better general knowledge of the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*than any other man in it,
and that you will give me the most correct information in your
power relative to the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*generally, and particularly that part
binding on the *location_mentioned*Gulf*/location_mentioned*. I have a considerable interest in the 
*location_mentioned*Nashville Companys Grant*/location_mentioned* and it would probably be more to my interest
to settle in that *location_mentioned*Grant */location_mentioned*than any other part of the *location_mentioned*province*/location_mentioned*—as I
could induce a great many *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*to emigrate to the section of
country that I select for my *location_mentioned*residence*/location_mentioned*, but I begin to think the *location_mentioned*Grant*/location_mentioned*
will never be colonised by the present *person_mentioned*Company*/person_mentioned*, unless some three
or four of us will take all the trouble upon us pay all the expense
and undergo all the privations dangers and difficulties of colonising
the *location_mentioned*Grant */location_mentioned*and then give the balance of the *person_mentioned*company */person_mentioned*their full share
of the lands without any charge. I was in *location_mentioned*Nashville */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1828">March last
*/date_mentioned*and prevailed on the *person_mentioned*Directors */person_mentioned*named in the late Grant to have a
meeting and try to make the necessary arrangements for colonising
the *location_mentioned*Grant */location_mentioned*and forward instructions forthwith to *person_mentioned*Majr League*/person_mentioned* on
that subject, call in their Old scrip and make new scrip agreeably
to the form you gave them, they promised me that they would do
so and calld a meeting which was attended by a bare majority and
they only talked of what they would do and concluded to call 
another meeting in a short time when they expected to have a full
*person_mentioned*Board */person_mentioned*and then would do every thing necessary and immediately
thereafter commence operations in every way necessary for 
colonising and promised to inform me what they did before I left 
*location_mentioned*Kentucky*/location_mentioned*, where I remained untill the *date_mentioned n="05-03-1828">3d. of May*/date_mentioned* and heard nothing
more from them Most of the *person_mentioned*Directors */person_mentioned*hold very small interests in
the *location_mentioned*Grant */location_mentioned*viz. 1/8 of a share and they care very little about it as
scarcely one of them ever intend emigrating to the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*. I
should probably have settled in that *location_mentioned*Grant */location_mentioned*if the *person_mentioned*Company */person_mentioned*had
done what they ought, to colonise it, but as they have not I have<barker_pb n="70"/>
determined to locate myself where my Judgment induces me to believe
is the best place for my own prívate interest after seeing you and
getting the best information I can.*/p*

*p*It will be some weeks before I can leave here to look at the
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and I shall be glad to receive a letter from you as soon
as convenient informing me whether you will be absent from home
any time this season and if so at what time as I do not wish to
go there in your absence, and any other information that you may
deem important will be thankfully received.*/p*
