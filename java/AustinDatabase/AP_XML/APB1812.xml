*p*Dear Sir My Extreem bad health precludes the possibilitys of
my Visiting your *location_mentioned*office */location_mentioned*as often as my business would require it
after weighing the Subject maturely I find it all important for the
interest of the *location_mentioned*Community */location_mentioned*to quiet the outrageous Clammer that
actually threatens at this moment the Over throw of every thing
and as a Step of Self preservation that I should by all means be
Released from serveing any longer as a *person_mentioned*Rigedore*/person_mentioned*, it is impossible
that my health can ever be restored under my present State of
Depressed and mortified feelings, my hopes and prospects are all
blasted; and my oppression is beyond the Controll of all the
philosiph[y] and fortitude I can Call to my aid my health has
actually Sunk, and unless I can produce a Change, the 
Conseiquences will be fatal to me and that Very Shortly, thare is no laber
or fatigue I would not willingly under go for the advancement of
the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*if my Exertions Could avail, but Such is the Violence
of feeling Existing against me at this moment, that any 
interfearance with the *person_mentioned*publick */person_mentioned*business by me or Even an Idea that I will
interfear infuriates them to madness—it is resolved that the next
*person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*shall not be contaminated with my (Rascally
intrigues) as they Say-—, be the conseiquences what they may—, my
own Idea is this, the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento */person_mentioned*will dispence with my meeting
them on account of my bad health and if it is possible for me to
obtain Two month leave of Absence from the *person_mentioned*Chief of Department*/person_mentioned*,<barker_pb n="302"/>
I wish to take a Trip to *location_mentioned*N. Orleans */location_mentioned*to See if it will not facilitate my
recovery, and if the *person_mentioned*Commissioner */person_mentioned*can be prevailed upon to represent
my Case to the Government at the Same time it is possible I may
obtain a total Exemption, and should I recover my health which I
have much reason to doubt I may be useful to the *person_mentioned*publick */person_mentioned*in 
someother way—, will you have the goodness to lay the case before the
*person_mentioned*comissioner */person_mentioned*and do all in your power for me, which I Shall always
acknowledge as the gratest of favours.*/p*
