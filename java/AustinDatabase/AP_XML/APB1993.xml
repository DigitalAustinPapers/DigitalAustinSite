*p*Mr Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I send herewith a few*location_mentioned* news papers*/location_mentioned*, in which you will find some
interesting debates in the *location_mentioned*House of Commons*/location_mentioned*, on the Mexican Trade,
you will also see the great anxiety evinced in that *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*to put a
stop to the contemplated*person_mentioned* Spanish Expedition*/person_mentioned*, against *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, the
manifest jealousy that exists there towards this *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, relative to
*location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, and *location_mentioned*S° America*/location_mentioned* generally, they do not even spare *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*,—
I presume they acquired their wild ideas about the *person_mentioned*Colonists */person_mentioned*of that
*location_mentioned*province*/location_mentioned*, from the recent *location_mentioned*Mexican publications*/location_mentioned*-
Such *person_mentioned*Swiss */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Germans */person_mentioned*as would be an acquisition to your
Colony, are not so easily prevailed on to go to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*as I imagined,
I find that those who have means, and are most deserving, leave their
*location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, in consequence of inducements held out to them by their
*person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*, who have already located in *location_mentioned*Ohio*/location_mentioned*, to come there, and that
they come with their minds made up, and prepared, and proceed 
immediately on their arrival to that State—those that are not worthy
of consideration, linger about, until chance provides imployment
for them— I should like to know how the Thermometer ranges in
your climate, they are afraid the heat is too intense for them,— I
should like to send a small vessel, with a good selection of them,
perhaps I may yet succeed, wish I knew what to ship at the same
time, that would pay a freight— I will write a *person_mentioned*German friend*/person_mentioned* of
mine*person_mentioned* Mr Gildermister*/person_mentioned* a very clever worthy fellow, who having ac<barker_pb n="454"/>
quired a handsome property in *location_mentioned*Havana */location_mentioned*has gone to *location_mentioned*Germany */location_mentioned*with
the intention of visiting *location_mentioned*Switserland*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*Russia*/location_mentioned*, etc., and give him such
information as I have, and request him, to communicate the same
to some *person_mentioned*Germans */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*swiss */person_mentioned*subjects, and see what effect it may
have, I regret I did not receive your letter before he left this, he
is an old, and very particular friend of mine, and I think will
take pleasure in attending to my request, the greatest difficulty will
be for my letter to reach him, he will be so much on the move, he
thought he should return again to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, prefering it as I
believe to all others— The more I think about your place, the more
I want to make you a visit, but I do not know how to manage it,
particularly at present—*/p*

*p*I hope your health has improved  [since] you last wrote—   let
me here from you when you can spare time to write—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Arch Austin*/person_mentioned* [Rubric]*/p*
*p*If *person_mentioned*G*/person_mentioned*—can only prevail on two or three *person_mentioned*Families */person_mentioned*to make the 
experiment, and they should be please [d] there will be no difficulty
in having as many to follow as you may wish-*/p*
