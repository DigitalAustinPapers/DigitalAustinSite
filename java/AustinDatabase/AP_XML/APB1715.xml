*p*My dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have for several days anticipated the present opportunity with
a full intention of writing copiously to my *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned**person_mentioned*friends*/person_mentioned*— but the
person by whom I send to *location_mentioned*Natchitoches */location_mentioned*sets out in the *date_mentioned n="05-05-1829">morning*/date_mentioned*
Some days earlier than he expected when I last saw him—   My time<barker_pb n="214"/>
is so short (for it is now 10 ociock p. m.) that I should let the 
conveyance pass by altogether were it not for my desire to transmit
to you the inclosed very <hi rend="italic">queer </hi>document—The *person_mentioned*author */person_mentioned*with whose
character I presume you are familiar? is now here-—he has Called on
me twice and seems to be deeply interested in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and perfectly
confident of the practicability of his Utopian <hi rend="italic">Social System</hi>, and its
peculiar adaptation to the condition or rather the "circumstances"
of our beautiful *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*— He appears to be influenced by a sincere
benevolence—but while I am willing to beleive he is an honest
*person_mentioned*philanthropist*/person_mentioned*, I am constrained to think him a misguided and
infatuated visionary— He leaves here in a few days for *location_mentioned*England*/location_mentioned*,
goes from thence to *location_mentioned*Colombia*/location_mentioned*, to enlighten the <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Liberator */person_mentioned*</hi>and from
thence he returns to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*to compleat his arrangements with that
*person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, and when <hi rend="italic">that shall be accomplished</hi>, he proposes
to pass over land to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Genl Wavill*/person_mentioned* with his *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*has been here about *date_mentioned n="04-21-1829">two weeks*/date_mentioned*—
his *person_mentioned*wife*/person_mentioned*, a very amiable *person_mentioned*English Lady*/person_mentioned* presented him with a fine
little *person_mentioned*daughter */person_mentioned**date_mentioned n="04-28-1829">this day a week ago.*/date_mentioned* He will leave in *date_mentioned n="05-14-1829">about 10 days*/date_mentioned*
and after visiting some of the *location_mentioned*eastern cities*/location_mentioned* will proceed to *location_mentioned*England*/location_mentioned*
where he expects to remain some time— I have found him an
intelligent gentlemanly man— I expect *person_mentioned*Milam */person_mentioned*here in a few days
and as I am informed, it is probable <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Peck */person_mentioned*</hi>will be with him—we shall
have quite a coterie of *person_mentioned*Coahuilatexanos*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I have no news of any peculiar interest. If I can have time in
the morning I'll put [up] a packet of papers for you. I regret very
much being so taken by surprise on this occassion but when I 
recollect that no one in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*has thought it worth while to write to me,
it seems as if I might be compromitting myself by multiplying my
unreciprocated communications— I have sent many letters and
many *location_mentioned*newspapers*/location_mentioned* since the waters rose and have not received an
acknowledgment of either—but I will not do so much discredit to
the frankness of others as to believe that any other motive will be
attributed to me than the true one, a desire to confer gratification
on those whom I esteem— Remember me very affectionately to all
friends *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Brown*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*League*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Nuckols */person_mentioned*etc etc and to *person_mentioned*Mrs Long*/person_mentioned*
and the *person_mentioned*Ladies */person_mentioned*generally—*/p*

*p*May God bless and preserve and prosper you—*/p*
