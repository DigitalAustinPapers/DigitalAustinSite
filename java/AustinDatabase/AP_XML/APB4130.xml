*p*I arrived here *date_mentioned n="01-08-1831">yesterday */date_mentioned*sin novedad, and shall leave in the 
*date_mentioned n="01-10-1831">morning*/date_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Dn Victor Blanco*/person_mentioned* recd me in his *location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*with great friendship
and attention—he has truly an amiable and interesting *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*. I
wrote you by *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*that *person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned* would appoint you his *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*to
select his *location_mentioned*land*/location_mentioned*—by this mail he will send you a power of attorney
to act as his *person_mentioned*agent*/person_mentioned*, and also as the *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*of many *person_mentioned*others*/person_mentioned*. I most
particularly request that you will try and make good selections for<barker_pb n="582"/>
*person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned*, lie wants the most of his *location_mentioned*land on the Trinity*/location_mentioned* low down
or on *location_mentioned*San Jacinto*/location_mentioned*. This *person_mentioned*gentleman */person_mentioned*is a very warm and sincere
*person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*and I hope you will spare no pains to get good selections
for him*/p*

*p*The accounts given to me here by *person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Tijerina */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*others*/person_mentioned*,
as to the general aspect of political affairs, amount in substance to
this—-that the present *person_mentioned*administration */person_mentioned*have all the effective portion
of the *person_mentioned*Army */person_mentioned*and all the *person_mentioned*Legislatures */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Governors */person_mentioned*of all the *location_mentioned*States*/location_mentioned*
in their favor, and most of the Talents and wealth of the nation.
They are of opinion that the present *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, will sustain itself and
that *person_mentioned*Guerrero */person_mentioned*must soon be put down entirely. *person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*others*/person_mentioned*
here, think that this *person_mentioned*administration */person_mentioned*is not hostile to *location_mentioned*North American*/location_mentioned*
emigration to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and that the present restrictions will be 
removed before this year concludes. They all say that my *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*
stands very high with the Govt, both in *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and in *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*. The
answer of our *person_mentioned*Ayto */person_mentioned*to that of *location_mentioned*Leona Vicario*/location_mentioned* has given general
satisfaction to all intelligent and reflecting men and has raised our
character more than you have any idea of. The *person_mentioned*Senate */person_mentioned*has 
approved of *person_mentioned*Carrillo*/person_mentioned*'s credentials as Senator, <hi rend="italic">unanimously </hi>, not one
vote in favor of the Jalapising System proposed by the *person_mentioned*Saltilleros*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*In *location_mentioned*Rio Grande*/location_mentioned* and in this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*(the only *location_mentioned*towns */location_mentioned*I have passed
through) I have been treated with more attention and respect than
I had any reason to expect. The opinion here is that *person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*will
not go to *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, he that he will proceed to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*in a short time.
The *person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*North American*/location_mentioned* emigration are beginning to suspect
that he is more friendly to them than they wish etc. etc. I give
these ideas as I have recd them. You see that they differ very much
from those intertained in *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*. When I get to *location_mentioned*headquarters */location_mentioned*I
shall be able to form some certain opinion on these subjects, in the
meantime it is best to pursue a prudent and silent course as to all
matters of politics.*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned*town at the crossing of the upper road on the Colorado*/location_mentioned* is yet
to name. I wish you would request *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*not to name it until
he hears from me on the subject.*/p*

*p*My *person_mentioned*colleague Padre Murquis*/person_mentioned* passed here on the *date_mentioned n="01-08-1831">8d of this month*/date_mentioned*,
I am told he intends to ask leave to resign, but *person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned* thinks that
it was under a belief that I would not come on.*/p*

*p*Try and get the*location_mentioned* coast colony*/location_mentioned* out of the way, before *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*gets
there so that you may have nothing to interfere with the other
business.*/p*

*p*The *location_mentioned*mountains round this place*/location_mentioned* are white with snow and ice and
the weather very cold and wet—my health is good.    The horses stand<barker_pb n="583"/>
the journey very well—corn in this place is only 75 cents to a dollar
the fanega I again recommend *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Dn Victor*/person_mentioned*'s land*/location_mentioned* matter to you 
particularly—that is, his <hi rend="italic">own claims</hi> the others are for his *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and
are of secondary consideration in comparison with his, for they want
the *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*for speculation—he wants it for his *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*, he has ten
*person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*, and a more promising *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*I have never seen,
remember me to*person_mentioned* Mrs. Sweet*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Sarah*/person_mentioned**/p*
