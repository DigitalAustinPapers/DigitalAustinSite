exacting from you taxes and Contributions which in your opinion
you ought not to pay on account of your being established on <location_mentioned>Lands
of the Republic of Mexico</location_mentioned>. At the same time petitioning 
protection and assistance from this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, as well to avoid those exactions
as for your defence against the incursions of the hostile <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>,

bounds of my faculties to remidy the evils which afflict you not
knowing the place where the division line between the two 
<location_mentioned>Republics </location_mentioned>will fall. You must therefore in the meantime bear with 
patience the disgusts of such treatment with the understanding that
under this date I forward your representation to <person_mentioned>His Excellency
the Governor of this State</person_mentioned> asking of him the necessary <person_mentioned>auxilliaries</person_mentioned>
for that part of the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>of which you will undoubtedly reap
[an advantage] should your fate decide that you are [to be a part
of] <location_mentioned>Mexican Territory</location_mentioned>. In which event, I [do not see] any 
objection to your provissionally forming and until the decission of the
<person_mentioned>Supreme Govt</person_mentioned>, is given to your representation all the branches of
organised government under a system already known and regulated
by the laws which you are acquainted with until those of the
