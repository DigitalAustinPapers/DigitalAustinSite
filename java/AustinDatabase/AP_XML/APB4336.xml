*p*Dear Sir, I have perused with some attention you letter of the
*date_mentioned n="01-30-1832">30 Jany */date_mentioned*last and think with you that the representatives of our 
lamented friend *person_mentioned*Hawkins */person_mentioned*has been sensurable, in the great neglect
shown with regard to the *location_mentioned*Texas grant*/location_mentioned* but I have some reason to
believe *person_mentioned*Col: John Thompson Mason*/person_mentioned* (now somewhere in the 
*location_mentioned*Mexican States*/location_mentioned*) has authority to divide *location_mentioned*land */location_mentioned*and settle all accounts.
Until the fate of his mission is known I shall urge the 
*person_mentioned*representatives */person_mentioned*no farther but should I be mistaken, there is now here a
*person_mentioned*relative */person_mentioned*who will visit you, and I presume be cloathed with full
power to act—   he will set out at any time that may be advised.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Carbajal*/person_mentioned* is still here but returns in a few days with quite
a small venture, having failed in making any collection from *person_mentioned*Mr
Bowie*/person_mentioned* as contemplated It affords me great pleasure to find his
conduct has been such as to gain your Esteem*/p*
