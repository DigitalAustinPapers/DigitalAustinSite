[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]

<p><date_mentioned n="07-01-1832">July 1. 1832</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr Sir—</p>

<p>A revolution—or rather a change of <person_mentioned>garrisons </person_mentioned>has taken place in
this town<person_mentioned>—Col. J. A. Mexia </person_mentioned>entered on the <date_mentioned n="06-28-1832">28 </date_mentioned>without opposition,
he fired three cannon shot at a small party of <person_mentioned>cavalry </person_mentioned>between this
and the <location_mentioned>Brazo</location_mentioned>, which dispersed them. The most of them joined him,
and escorted him <location_mentioned>into town</location_mentioned>, for he brought none but <person_mentioned>infantry</person_mentioned>, as he
came by water.</p>

<p>I have never seen anything conducted with so much good order—
one <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>quietly marched off towards <location_mentioned>San Fernando</location_mentioned>, and the other
as quietly marched in and took up quarters in the <location_mentioned>barracks</location_mentioned>. The
ordinary business of the <person_mentioned>merchants </person_mentioned>was not interrupted one hour—
not one cent of private property has been touched—not one act of
confusion nor even of disorder has occurred since <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>arrived.
By the by, he is a very different man <hi rend="italic">now </hi>from what he was when
you knew him—he has had ten years experience, a great part of the
time as <person_mentioned>Secretary of Legation in <location_mentioned>Washington city</</location_mentioned>person_mentioned>—he is now a useful,
and I think quite a liberal and good man, I am much pleased
with him.</p>

<p>I have written to <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>by the express which left here on the
<date_mentioned n="06-27-1832">27</date_mentioned>, also <date_mentioned n="06-28-1832">day before yesterday</date_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>cap Ross</person_mentioned> of the <hi rend="italic">Exert </hi>bound to
<location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned>, he promised to call at the <location_mentioned>mouth of the river</location_mentioned>. I also
wrote to <person_mentioned>Musquis</person_mentioned>, to the <person_mentioned>Alcalde</person_mentioned> to <person_mentioned>John </person_mentioned>and to you.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>is ordered to take command at <location_mentioned>Anahuac</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Duclor </person_mentioned>is
ordered <location_mentioned>from the mouth of the river to Brazoria</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Cortina is 
provisional collector of <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned>.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>The course for the people there to take in the present distracted
state of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>, is to declare that <hi rend="italic">they will take no part in the civil
war at all—that they will do their duty strictly as <person_mentioned>Mexican 
Citizens</person_mentioned>—that they will adhere to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and to the gen. and State
constitution, and resist any unjust attacks upon either, by any, or by
all <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>no matter who they may be.</hi></p>

<p>This must be the basis of all they do, or say,—that is, should they
find themselves bound to do, or say anything to protect their personal<barker_pb n="808"/>
security and property from unjust and arbitrary attacks-—but should
there be no such necessity they ought not to say, or do anything—
a dead calm is the best.</p>

<p>I am told the <person_mentioned>chief of department</person_mentioned> has gone on—<hi rend="italic">he must act</hi>, and
sustain the dignity of the <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>. I recd an officio from<person_mentioned> Genl Teran
</person_mentioned>informing that he had ordered <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>to advise with me, and
put himself <hi rend="italic">de accuerdo</hi> with me, I am requested to do the same
with <person_mentioned>Ugartechea</person_mentioned>—in obedience, and full complyance with this request
I have written to <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>twice. I sent a copy of my first letter
to the <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>by the <person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>, and of the last by the <hi rend="italic">Exert</hi>, and I now
enclose you another for <person_mentioned>Ugartechea</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>From the best information I can get I think that <person_mentioned>Teran </person_mentioned>will be
upon <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>in this place in a day or two with his whole <person_mentioned>force</person_mentioned>—if so it
will be a bad business, and I fear the result for <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>is in a just and
good cause and deserves to get through well—his movement here
was bold and prompt, and well managed.</p>

<p>I say that he is in a good cause for the reason that what is called
the <person_mentioned>Santana party</person_mentioned>, is in fact the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">democratic republican federal</hi> part</person_mentioned>y
of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>, opposed to the <person_mentioned>aristocratic party</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have waited here to see the event of these things before I went
to <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>—shall probably start <date_mentioned n="07-02-1832">tomorrow</date_mentioned> if nothing new occurs.
Tho if <person_mentioned>Teran </person_mentioned>is close at hand, I will wait and see the end of his
attack, he will take the place of course, for his <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>is very 
superior—it is said that <person_mentioned>Moctezuma </person_mentioned>has taken the field, which it was
thought would detain <person_mentioned>Teran</person_mentioned>, but I doubt that-—it is not certain.
How horrid is civil war. God keep it away from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>will
not go to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, there is no object he can affect by going there, but
on the contrary it would only make confusion. I have advised him
not to go there and he will not—neither did he intend to go when
he left <location_mentioned>Tampico</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Governor of the State Vital Fernandez</person_mentioned> came with him from
<location_mentioned>Tampico</location_mentioned>, the<person_mentioned> Lieut, Govr Juan Molano</person_mentioned> is also here.</p>

<p>Keep peace in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and if there is anything done, mind the
<hi rend="italic">main basis</hi>, Union to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, <hi rend="italic">and obedience and adherence to the
Constitution,</hi> repeat this basis in all that is done, and all that is
said—never loose sight of it one moment.</p>

<p>I have had a good deal of talk with <person_mentioned>Fisher</person_mentioned>, and am reconciled
with him—his intentions were better than were supposed, but he
greatly mistook the means and committed imprudencies of which
he is now aware—he never intended to go back—or at least not
soon—let him alone—say no more about him—he is an unfortunate
man and anything said against him now will be taken for persecu-<barker_pb n="809"/>
tion—he would finally have done well and made a good collector,
but he thought that he must be very rigid at first—</p>

<p>Let the past be forgotten—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Teran </person_mentioned>was still in <location_mentioned>victoria </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="06-27-1832">27</date_mentioned>.</p>
