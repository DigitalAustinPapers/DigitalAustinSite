*p*Dear Sir,*/p*

*p*Your seeming unwillingness to converse on the subject I named
to you this *date_mentioned n="01-08-1831">morning*/date_mentioned*, prevented my saying to you all I had intended
on the subject of my petition to *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*for an augmentation of *location_mentioned*land*/location_mentioned*.<barker_pb n="581"/>
My reasons for my intended petition is not a mere idle whim, it is
because I was amongst the first who emigrated to the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, It
will shortly be eight years since I made the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*my home. At
that time, and nearly ever since, I have been engaged in a business,
altogether profitable to the *location_mentioned*community*/location_mentioned*, and for many reasons well
known to yourself, it has been quite the contrary to myself. I lost
all my property that was of value to me at my first landing, to
the amt. of upwards of $500.*/p*

*p*The business I have followed could not be profitable to me, until
the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*should flourish, in consequence of which my last
seven years has been spent in a labour, that is hard and rough, living
in the woods, during all of which time, I have been saving and
economical, and at this moment find myself not only poor, but
largely in debt.*/p*

*p*I have therefore thought, that as the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*has been proffitted
by the business I have followed, and has been of public utility,
that it might entitle me to a claim on the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, for a 
remuneration of the losses I have sustained in her services. I wish no extra
acquisition of *location_mentioned*lands */location_mentioned*unless I merit them, and whether I do or not,
depends on the reasons above stated, all of which, comes within
your knowledge*/p*.
