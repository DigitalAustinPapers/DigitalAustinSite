*p*It gives me much pleasure to inform you that the decree repealing
the 11 article of the law of *date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">6 April 1830*/date_mentioned* passed the *person_mentioned*chamber of
deputies*/person_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="10-24-1833">yesterday */date_mentioned*almost unanimously, and was discussed today in
the *person_mentioned*senate */person_mentioned*and two articles were approved (there are three articles
in the decree) when the *person_mentioned*senate */person_mentioned*adjourned. There was strong 
opposition in the *person_mentioned*senate */person_mentioned*on the ground that the *person_mentioned*Govt, of the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*.*/person_mentioned* would
take *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*if any more were alowed to come in from that *location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*and
many other very foolish and absurd objections, but the majority were
in favor of the law and I am told there is no doubt the other article
will pass *date_mentioned n="10-24-1833">tomorrow*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Genl. Santana*/person_mentioned* is expected in the *location_mentioned*city */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="10-26-1833">three days*/date_mentioned* and after he
arrives I will try (a final tryal) on the *location_mentioned*state */location_mentioned*question. I told the
*person_mentioned*vice President*/person_mentioned* the other day that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*must be made a *location_mentioned*state */location_mentioned*by the
*person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, or she would make herself one. This he took as a threat and
became very much enraged—however when he understood that my
object was only to state a positive fact which it was my duty to
state, he was reconciled. I had told him and the *person_mentioned*ministers */person_mentioned*the same
thing ever since I came here. The fact is this *person_mentioned*govt*/person_mentioned*, ought to make
a *location_mentioned*state of Texas*/location_mentioned*, or transfer her to the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* without delay and
there is some probability at this time that one or the other will be
done. A short time now will determine this matter in some way No
one writes to me from *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*I hope you have taken 
possession of all my papers desk etc that is if it be true as reported here
that *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*is dead, which I hope to God is not the case. I left
blanks signed to close the *location_mentioned*coast colony*/location_mentioned* and should they fall into bad
hands an improper use might be made of them— take possession of
them all—*/p*

*p*I have had to draw on *location_mentioned*Orleans */location_mentioned*for one thousand dollars. This
trip will cost me very dear, but I care nothing about that if either of
the two events above mentioned can take place, or if any good results
to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and its *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*— all my desires and ambition are limited
to the sole object of benefiting that *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—tho I must confess that
some of the *person_mentioned*good folks*/person_mentioned* there irritate me very much sometimes with
their personal animosities and jealousies—but it is of short duration.*/p*<barker_pb n="1009"/>
