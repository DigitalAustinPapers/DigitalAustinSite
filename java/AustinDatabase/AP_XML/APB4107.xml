*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*I have the satisfaction of acknowledging the receipt of yours of *date_mentioned n="10-02-1830">2d
October*/date_mentioned* from *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*, and of informing you of the safe arrival
of the Nelson. I recd a letter *date_mentioned n="12-13-1830">yesterday */date_mentioned*from *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* stating
that the Nelson was at *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*and he was then unloading your
goods—She lost her false keel coming over the *location_mentioned*bar */location_mentioned*and thumped
severely—the *location_mentioned*bar */location_mentioned*is much worse than when you came over—*person_mentioned*Henry
Austin*/person_mentioned* came near loosing his Steam boat going out, he put to Sea
very much damaged and I have not heard of him since—*/p*

*p*I wrote to *person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*to follow your instructions strickly as to the goods,
and not open them untill *person_mentioned*Mr Hunter*/person_mentioned* arrives.   I have not yet finished<barker_pb n="556"/>
the *location_mentioned*Store house*/location_mentioned*, it is raised (in this place) the Shingles are hawled—
the plank is all sawed and wagons have gone after it—So that I
hope it will be ready by the time *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*arrives—I have no *location_mentioned*house*/location_mentioned*
under way for the *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*—you will get out in the *date_mentioned n="SPring-1831">Spring */date_mentioned*and the
weather will be pleasant, and you can get along very well untill
some *location_mentioned*buildings */location_mentioned*are put up—*person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*has seen a *location_mentioned*new country*/location_mentioned* in times
long past and can manage very well for a month or two—The fact
is I have no one to attend to business and if I undertake to build
while I am absent it will cost ten prices. My advise is that you
build on the *location_mentioned*out lots above *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned*; in this place on the creek—-I
think the situation a healthy one-*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Edwards */person_mentioned*gets the *location_mentioned*League at the point*/location_mentioned*-—There was no other way
of arranging the thing—-The *location_mentioned*tract between the two creeks*/location_mentioned* I think
is the best *location_mentioned*Stock farm*/location_mentioned* in the*location_mentioned* lower country,*/location_mentioned* and I am clearly of
opinion that Stock is the best business that can be followed, and if
you intend to go into that business the *location_mentioned*Clear Creek*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*Dickensons
Creek */location_mentioned*is the best tract you can get—I am very anxious for you to
be here. We can soon fix ourselves comfortably—the *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*will
have to undergo some privations the first year I leave here the *date_mentioned n="12-16-1830">day
after tomorrow */date_mentioned*for *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*and shall not be back untill *date_mentioned n="06-xx-1831">June*/date_mentioned*, and I
then hope to see you all here in health—. I have left my will with
*person_mentioned*S. M. Williams */person_mentioned*and he has a power of attorney to attend to all my
business, there is considerable due me and you can get work and
plank etc. without paying money Also I wish you to begin 
collecting cattle due me—I think it will be a good plan to bring a *person_mentioned*mexican
family*/person_mentioned* with me from *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*I have heard nothing from *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*and am very uneasy about
him—the *location_mentioned*Brazos bar*/location_mentioned* is very dangerous *location_mentioned*Galveston */location_mentioned*must be the
*location_mentioned*principal port*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*Call on *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*for any notes due me or all of them—and use
any thing of mine as if it was yours without any kind of reserve.
If I live through these two years, I am done for the balance of my
life with all kind of public matters*/p*

*p*The person who takes this is waiting so I will close by wishing
you all a safe journey and good health*/p*

*p*farewell*/p*
