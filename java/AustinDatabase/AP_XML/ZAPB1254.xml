<p>Dr sir,</p>

<p>I came here <date_mentioned n="08-17-1826">last thursday evening</date_mentioned> in Company with your <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>others</person_mentioned>, your <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>, myself and <person_mentioned>others </person_mentioned>of the <person_mentioned>Company </person_mentioned>have
been very unwell tho we are all on the mend. <person_mentioned>Capt. Bowen</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr.
Moor</person_mentioned> are also mending. There is considerable Sickness here amongst
the <person_mentioned>soldiers </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Your <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>has written you relative to the suspension of <person_mentioned>Genl
San Bernardo</person_mentioned>, and the appointment of your friend <person_mentioned>Bustemantas </person_mentioned>to
the office of <person_mentioned>Comt- General</person_mentioned>, in his stead—He has also given you all
the information that has been recd> here in relation to the <person_mentioned>Slaves</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Slave </person_mentioned>Law.</p>

<p>I am happy to learn that you have recovered your health; and
regret to hear that <person_mentioned>Mr. Williams</person_mentioned> has been so very sick—hope he has
ere this recovered.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Delion </person_mentioned>has Commited some atrocious Outrages on some <person_mentioned>American
travelers</person_mentioned> who were on the way here on business with the Govt-
What the result will be I am not able to say. I shall lay the
Memorial of <person_mentioned>Mr. Stout</person_mentioned> before the <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>to day relative to <person_mentioned>Delion</person_mentioned>s
ill treating and robing of him.</p>

<p>I find the <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>to be a man of easy access, and is very afible with
me It appears that he (the chief) is Determined to Consider
<person_mentioned>Delion</person_mentioned>, An <person_mentioned>Empresario </person_mentioned>Over an <location_mentioned>undefined District</location_mentioned> for 40 <person_mentioned>familes</person_mentioned>;
and wishes the<location_mentioned> bounds between <person_mentioned>Dewitt </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Delion</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> to be agreed ou
between themselves.</p>

<p>I have proposed to let <person_mentioned>Delion </person_mentioned>Go <location_mentioned>Eastward to the Grassite [Gar-
citas], and up and Down the Guadalupe</location_mentioned> for quantity; giving to
<person_mentioned>Dewitt </person_mentioned><location_mentioned>all the Labacca</location_mentioned>; but he will not make an order to that effect,
without the consent of <person_mentioned>Delion</person_mentioned>, or the consent of the <person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>on
the part of <person_mentioned>Delion</person_mentioned>, who is not yet appointed. It appears to me that
<person_mentioned>Dewitt </person_mentioned>will have to appeal to the Govt to obtain his right; this 
however will I presume Depend on the advice you may give on the
subject.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>has promised to furnish the fee bill to me, to Day.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to your <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>for his polite attention, and
assistance here,</p>

<p>I have mentioned to the <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>the propriety of inviting <person_mentioned>fields </person_mentioned>to
partisipate in the War against the hostile <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>; he said that he
had written to him to come here and to bring his title papers to <location_mentioned>land</location_mentioned>
if he had any with a view to assertain the strength of his claim, and
to make some arrangements with him in assisting to Defend the
<location_mentioned>frontiers</location_mentioned>.   He requested me to write <person_mentioned>fields </person_mentioned>on the subject by the first<barker_pb n="1436"/>
oppertunity and urge him to come on. The mail leaves here <date_mentioned n="08-24-1826">to
morrow</date_mentioned>, and I somewhat expect I shall do so too; but I cannot say
when I shall be able to get to <location_mentioned>San felipe</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>You will perceive from reading this that my mind is too weak and,
Ideas too scattering to write. A few nights ago I Dreamd, that the
last object of my hopes was laid<location_mentioned> beneath the Sod on the Gloomy hill
in the prairie near San felipe</location_mentioned>: This with other difficulties keeps me
in Despair</p>

<p>My Respects to <person_mentioned>Mr & Mrs pettes</person_mentioned> also <person_mentioned>Mrs Williams</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Wightman</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>James Kerr</person_mentioned></p>
