*p*My Dear Sir, Your welcome favour of the *date_mentioned n="11-12-1832">12th Nov.*/date_mentioned* came to
hand last week, it was no doubt delayed owing to the Suspension
and disorder of our mail arrangements; I regret that my time is so
much taken up at this moment as to deprive me of the pleasure I
would have in replying fully to your interesting letter, but as our
correspondence will become more regular in future, I will find
leisure to enter upon details. *person_mentioned*Chambers */person_mentioned*I consider has treated me
ill not having replied to any of my letters Since he received his
books; nor has he paid even to my *person_mentioned*correspondents in *location_mentioned*N. Orleans*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* their
value as he promised to do when he gave the order. With the plan
of *location_mentioned*zavaleta*/location_mentioned*, hostilities have ceased; but the amalgam I fear will, not
give us a permanent peace; all appears to be quiet but not solid;
Some of the *location_mentioned*States*/location_mentioned*, will not Subscribe to the plan, others have;
*person_mentioned*Genl. Pedraza*/person_mentioned* is however of opinion, that all will go right; my
opinion is that the *date_mentioned n="04-04-1833">4th of april next*/date_mentioned* will not pass by without, a
noise In relation to the 11th Arto, of the law of the *date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">6th of april
1830*/date_mentioned*; there are thousands here who are interested in its repeal
Strong remonstrances will therefore be made; and the *person_mentioned*Executive */person_mentioned*is
Strongly indisposed against the Said law, and in order to prepare
the way for its repeal I will manouvre with the *location_mentioned*liberal presses*/location_mentioned*, and
if I have time will translate and have published, Some paragraphs
of your letter, as written by a <hi rend="italic">Texano</hi>. I Sometimes dabble in 
politics; but my commercial occupations rarely give me time to think
of any thing else but <hi rend="italic">business </hi>While you remain in the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*,
write me and When in the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* I hope to hear from you; I will
Send you Some of the most interesting Numbers of the Phoenix.
The *location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Registro </hi>*/location_mentioned*is dead; The *person_mentioned*friends of the constitution*/person_mentioned* are trying to
revive it.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*W. S. Parrott*/person_mentioned*   [Rubric]*/p*

*p*(P. S.) *person_mentioned*Genl Mexia*/person_mentioned* Sends you his remembrance We will work
together for the repeal of the law in question. *person_mentioned*Genl. Filasola*/person_mentioned* goes

*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*He has a *location_mentioned*grant near the red river*/location_mentioned* abot which we have had
several conversations He will go to *location_mentioned*Matamoras */location_mentioned*by land from thence
