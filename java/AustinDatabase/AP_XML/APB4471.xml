*p**location_mentioned*Detroit*/location_mentioned*, *date_mentioned n="11-12-1832">Nov. 12,1832,*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear Sir,*/p*

*p*I have the satisfaction of introducing to your acquaintance *person_mentioned*Mr.
Robert Le Roy*/person_mentioned*, (a connexion of mine) and *person_mentioned*Mr. E. Comstock*/person_mentioned*. They
are young men of the strictest "probity, of the most exemplary habits,
and possessing enterprise and industry so as to render them an 
acquisition to your *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, and to ensure to themselves an enviable
independence. They are but the *person_mentioned*pioneers of several families */person_mentioned*who
will leave this part of the *location_mentioned*U. States*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">next season*/date_mentioned* for *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and they
wish to find a place which will justify them in erecting a *location_mentioned*saw mill
*/location_mentioned*and other *location_mentioned*works*/location_mentioned*, and which will warrant the formation of a 
*location_mentioned*neighborhood */location_mentioned*of fifteen or twenty *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*. With the *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*, (which
will be formed into an *person_mentioned*emigrating company*/person_mentioned*) it is my intention to be<barker_pb n="886"/>
numbered—indeed, it is from my advice and representations, that
the plan has been adopted—consequently, you must be aware of my
solicitude respecting the location of the contemplated *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*. I
was much delighted with the district of *location_mentioned*country in the vicinity of
*person_mentioned*Brookfield*/person_mentioned*'s*/location_mentioned*, but am not certain that water power of sufficient 
magnitude can be had without it is found some *location_mentioned*10 or 15 miles from him*/location_mentioned*,
in some of the *location_mentioned*bends of the Colorado*/location_mentioned*. A water power and timber
would be desirable. The former, I was told, is abundant in the 
*location_mentioned*interior far as your most northern grant*/location_mentioned*as —please direct the young
*person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*to those parts where they will be most likely to find what they
desire, and also tell them what the advantages are for industrious
*person_mentioned*agriculturists */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*stock raisers*/person_mentioned*. These young men are a sample of
those that will emigrate *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">next season*/date_mentioned*; and are such as will do, each
of them, more actual labor, either as *person_mentioned*merchanics */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*agriculturists*/person_mentioned*,
than three or four men, *person_mentioned*black */person_mentioned*or *person_mentioned*white*/person_mentioned*, that have been reared with
southern habits—they are just such as I know you wish to see
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*filled with—and just such as your glorious country deserves.
I am more and more impressed with the correctness of your views,
as expressed to me, relative to the destinies of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and the proper
policy to be pursued.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Le Roy*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Mr. Comstock*/person_mentioned* will inform you of the extent of
the desire to emigrate to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, among the *person_mentioned*people of the *location_mentioned*county*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* in
which they live—the feeling is spread far even in this *location_mentioned*new country*/location_mentioned*,
from even the slight information which has been diseminated among
them. What then could not be done in the *location_mentioned*eastern and northern
states*/location_mentioned*, in the way of forming *person_mentioned*emigrating companies*/person_mentioned*, if proper
measures were adopted ?*/p*

*p*I feel, sir, that I have embarked in an important business, (the
arrangement and formation of an *person_mentioned*emigrating party*/person_mentioned*) and it would
always be a source of regret to me, to be instrumental in deceiving
the hopes or just expectations of any one: for this reason, sir, I feel
that every particle of information from *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, at all affecting the
interests and well-being of the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*, will be of high importance,
I assure, you, sir, that those who emigrate with me shall not have it
to say that I withheld or misstated any thing in my power to 
communicate, and important for them to know.*/p*

*p*By the latest information which has reached me from *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*, I
perceive that *person_mentioned*Santa Anna */person_mentioned*has met a reverse in the defeat of 
*person_mentioned*Moctezuma*/person_mentioned*—and that he himself is in somewhat a critical situation. Tell
me, sir, should those against whom *person_mentioned*Santa Anna*/person_mentioned* took up arms, 
prevail against him, will they dare attempt to be avenged on those of
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*who have declared in his favor? Or will they dare attempt
to narrow the privileges of your *person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned*, from the disposition
which they have manifested to abrogate the abominable law to pre-<barker_pb n="887"/>
vent emigration, and the desire which they have expressed to be a
sovereign state of the *location_mentioned*Republic*/location_mentioned*? For myself, I am certain that, let
the civil commotion terminate as it may, the *person_mentioned*people of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* need
not, from that result, be subjected to any loss, or have their prospects
of rapid advancement in wealth and importance, much impeded—so
sure am I that the *person_mentioned*dominant party in *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*,*/person_mentioned* must be aware of the
strength, the spirit, and the resources of the *person_mentioned*people of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*. At
all events, you would oblige me much by letting me know your views,
so that I can have it in my power to reassure those who may feel
fearful about the peace of the *person_mentioned*Settlers*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*You may rest assured, sir, that the *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*who will compose the
*person_mentioned*emigrating party*/person_mentioned* to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will be just such as you will rejoice to
see—respectable, intelligent, and industrious such as you find always
among the *person_mentioned*most valuable citizens of our villages in *location_mentioned*N. York*/location_mentioned* or 
*location_mentioned*Pennsylvania*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*: for they will for the most part be people from the states
who have removed here, and find the winters too rigorous. All our
*person_mentioned*farmers */person_mentioned*indeed, appear to be sighing for your genial climate and
rich meadows and soil.*/p*

*p*Should you happen to see *person_mentioned*Doctr N. Labadie, of *location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, please
inform him that his *person_mentioned*mother */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*connexions */person_mentioned*are well, and wish very
much to receive a letter from him.*/p*

*p*Give my best wishes to *person_mentioned*Mr Williams*/person_mentioned* and other gentlemen of my
acquaintance and beleive me, sir,*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Col S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Jno P Sheldon*/person_mentioned* [Rubric]*/p*
