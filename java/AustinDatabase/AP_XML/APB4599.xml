*p*I am so much afflicted by accounts of the deaths by cholera in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*
that I can scarcely write anything. I have heard of *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned*,
his *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*child */person_mentioned*and of my [dear?] *person_mentioned*sister's daughter Mary*/person_mentioned*. . . .
*person_mentioned*Cap. Martin*/person_mentioned*.   Good God what a blow.   And whether it has taken<barker_pb n="1007"/>
you all off is uncertain.   I am too wretched to write much on this
subject or any other.*/p*

*p*I left with *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*a great number of deeds signed by me so
that he might furnish all the titles of the . . . *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*. Take 
possession of them and of all my papers. Should these blanks fall into
bad hands they will make any use of them they please.*/p*

*p*I will try and get home as soon as I can. There has been no 
meeting of *person_mentioned*Congress */person_mentioned*since early in *date_mentioned n="08-xx-1833">August */date_mentioned*until a few days since, so
that nothing is done. I shall wait but a short time longer. I am
tired of this *person_mentioned*government*/person_mentioned*. They are always in revolution and I 
believe always will be. I have had much more respect for them than
they deserve. But I am done with all that. You do not write to me
[no one] writes to me.   farewell*/p*
