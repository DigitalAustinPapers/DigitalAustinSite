*p*Dr Sir.*/p*

*p*I wrote you *date_mentioned n="05-22-1832">yesterday */date_mentioned*by mail, since then *person_mentioned*Mr Greaves*/person_mentioned* has 
concluded to go on direct to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and not follow *person_mentioned*Mason */person_mentioned*and self
in the <hi rend="italic">vuelta </hi>by *location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*through <hi rend="italic">heat </hi>and <hi rend="italic">war</hi>. you will find him
a very usefull man, much more so than any I have ever seen in
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*for an office where Spanish and english is needed. You
must make good use of the time between this and *date_mentioned n="01-xx-1833">Jany */date_mentioned*to bring
up all the back writing of the *location_mentioned*office*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I sent you from *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*by mail, all the necessary papers to
finish the titles for the *location_mentioned*lands */location_mentioned*granted to the *person_mentioned*Aguirres */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Vega*/person_mentioned*<barker_pb n="776"/>
with directions as to locating it—on reflection I think I shall return
*location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*from *location_mentioned*Matamoros*/location_mentioned*—that is if I am not detained too long in
getting there, and in that event I will attend to their location 
myself—but I wish you to employ a *person_mentioned*person of confidence*/person_mentioned* to explore
the land *location_mentioned*up the San Jacinto, west side,*/location_mentioned* and see if one of the *location_mentioned*grants*/location_mentioned*
can not be located there <hi rend="italic">entire </hi>to advantage, have this done without
delay so that I may know when I get there whether to take it or
not. I wish the location on *location_mentioned*Onion Creek west side of Colorado,*/location_mentioned*
and on the *location_mentioned*east side at the foot of the mountains*/location_mentioned*, also the *location_mentioned*cedar
league N° 4 above Bastrop*/location_mentioned*—. <hi rend="italic">Enfin </hi>this land will cost me very dear
and unless it is well located I shall loose on it.*/p*

*p*You will see by the new colonization law that all sales heretofore
made must be located within 18 months—this will cause a great
push, and unless some care is taken all the land in our *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*will be
occupied by them—keep this in view—also remember that I have
very advantageous offers to settle that *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*which I shall decide
upon after seeing the *person_mentioned*General*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Above all things keep peace and harmony in the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*. We
have <hi rend="italic">all sorts</hi> of reports here about *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, and it is said that three
*person_mentioned*soldiers */person_mentioned*were killed at *location_mentioned*Anahuac */location_mentioned*by the crew of a vessell. I hope this
is not so—do keep peace in that *location_mentioned*quarter*/location_mentioned*—urge this on the *person_mentioned*Ayto */person_mentioned*and
on *person_mentioned*every one*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Remember me to *person_mentioned*Sarah */person_mentioned*and all others.*/p*
