*p*My Dear *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I improve an opportunity which offers itself by a gentleman of
sending this into the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned*, and I hope you will receive it
in due time.*/p*

*p*A short time since I returned to this place; from which I
have been absent two or three months on a place down on this *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*
where I am opening a *person_mentioned*farm */person_mentioned*and building a <hi rend="italic">Cotton Gin</hi>, I shall remain here no longer than the absence of *person_mentioned*Stephen*/person_mentioned* compels me he is
absent on a topographical tour to *location_mentioned*Galveston*/location_mentioned* to exicute a comission
given him by the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*.    I expect him in*date_mentioned n="03-02-1826"> one or two days*/date_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*On my return to this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*I found letters from you which gave
me much pleasure and satisfaction. I hope you will not attribute
my long silence to any thing but the remote distance and insolated
state that I have been in for the last two or three months—Nothing
would distress me more my Dr *person_mentioned*Emily*/person_mentioned* than for me to imagine that
you should entertain the smallest doubt that I had abated my
affection for you in the least or that I did not take and feel the
deepest interest for your happiness, What has this world to endear
me to it but my *person_mentioned*Sister*/person_mentioned* and her lovely *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*? altho debared the
inexpressible pleasure and satisfaction of enjoying her society (and
the <hi rend="italic">sweet prattle</hi> of her little ones) I sincerely hope and flatter myself
that the period is not far distant when we shall all be reunited, (if
not under the same roof) so near that we can form a social circle
and " far from the scenes of strife <hi rend="italic">pass the innocent</hi> jest, and
chaunt the merry glee"—then we can remind each other of "<hi rend="italic">Auld
Lang Syne</hi> " and congratulate ourselves that not withstanding the
many visissitudes and difficulties we have encountered (and the
great and heartfelt satisfaction afforded to the *person_mentioned*Enemies of our house
*/person_mentioned*by its downfall) <hi rend="italic">we have proved to the *location_mentioned*world*/location_mentioned*</hi> that <hi rend="italic">regardless</hi> of
them all—We <hi rend="italic">have</hi> accomplished an enterprize that will perpetuate
our name and place it with honor on the page of history It will
then be our turn to triumph—shall we do so ? I can see a sentiment
of just Resentment pervades your Breast—but I also see a generous
principle a <hi rend="italic">something</hi> so noble rising still above that—checking the
first impulse of anger—and appealing to reason to treat the past <barker_pb n="1269"/>
with silent contempt—Our old *person_mentioned*Enemies */person_mentioned*will in a few years more
dwindle into insignificance and would lick the dust from our shoes
to gain a favor—It will then be a satisfaction a "heavenly satisfaction ["] for me to assist them—That is the revenge which will be
sweet to me—*/p*

*p*I was truly shocked to hear of the murder committed on the person
of *person_mentioned*Wm M Perry*/person_mentioned* I receivd the letter of *person_mentioned*Saml Perry*/person_mentioned* to my *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned*
informing him of the circumstance and containing an advertisement,
you may assure him that every exertion in our power will be made
to apprehend the *person_mentioned*Villian*/person_mentioned* that he may receive the punishment he so
justly merits.*/p*

at this time than it ever has before, there is a prospect of an overflowing Emigration this *date_mentioned n="Spring - 1826">spring */date_mentioned*and next *date_mentioned n="Fall- 1826">fall */date_mentioned*of some of the most
respectable men in the *location_mentioned*United States*/location_mentioned*.*/p*
