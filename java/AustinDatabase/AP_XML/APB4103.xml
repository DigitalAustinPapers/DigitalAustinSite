*p*Dr Sir,*/p*

*p*I received yours of*date_mentioned n="12-06-1830"> 6th*/date_mentioned* today— I am much pleased to learn from
you that the subject I offered to your Consideration had been 
receiving it before—   It argued me at least, not a <hi rend="italic">lone </hi>dreamer—*/p*

*p*I shall be much gratified some future day to talk it over with
you at our Convenience.*/p*

*p*You observe the *location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">" Main Spring "</hi>*/location_mentioned* has brought me quite promptly
to accept your influence for a League of Land, " Hombre Soltero "
tho' I am—*/p*

*p*I should in the event of the petitions succeding like to have it
located on the *location_mentioned*Karankaway (the East branch)*/location_mentioned* in case of forfeitures,
which from what I understand are extremely probable as to some
few—far more than enough of Course to let me in— There is time
enough for that— Something certain may be effected by your
Consent When something more Certain is Known as to the *person_mentioned*persons*/person_mentioned*
likely to fail,—*/p*

*p*As to the Kind of Court, the people are wanting this <hi rend="italic">ambulatory</hi>
Kind of one—they are just seeking the means of their own Wicked
Discord—to have them just at hand for every day use— The 
Miserable <hi rend="italic">glory </hi>of having a suit in the <hi rend="italic">big Court</hi>, as it would seem to
hide many a *person_mentioned*scoundrels */person_mentioned*worthlessness,—how many would it entice<barker_pb n="553"/>
to that Witching height of momentary greatness—the subject a
<hi rend="italic">shadow!</hi>*/p*

*p*I had an especial eye to that evil in refering to them in my
thoughts.   A big Court as it were on every *location_mentioned*plantation*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*The Theatre for display before the local *person_mentioned*Magistrate */person_mentioned*would be a
poor one and would I think tempt but a few comparatively to figure
upon it, to show their dexterity in litigation and reap a wonderful
Conspicuousness—*/p*
