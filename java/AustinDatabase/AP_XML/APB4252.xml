*p**location_mentioned*Gonzales */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="08-05-1831">5 August 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Respected Sir*/p*

*p*A short respite from almost incessant writing enables me by this
opportunity to make my acknowledgments for the Kindness 
(unmerited altogether) with which you have favor'd an individual 
personally a *person_mentioned*stranger */person_mentioned*to you; the value of which is doubly enhanced<barker_pb n="687"/>
by the testimony it affords of the disposition of the *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*to reward
in a reasonable way the services however humble of those who have
been instrumental in defence of the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*, and the source by
which it has been received, as without your interference, it would
in all human probability have continued for me a dead letter—*/p*

*p*On reverting to Art's 10, 22 and 27 of Law *date_mentioned n="03-24-1828">24 Mar*/date_mentioned*: it appears
that this species of *location_mentioned*grant */location_mentioned*is exempted from paymt of any dues to
the *location_mentioned*State*/location_mentioned*, this has not been attended to in my case, tho' *person_mentioned*officers
in the Navy*/person_mentioned* from a Mid' in the line of promotion are " *person_mentioned*Militares */person_mentioned*"
and I would feel oblig'd for your opinion whether it is worth
troubling the *person_mentioned*Govr */person_mentioned*with a representation or whether a saving clause
could not be inserted in the deed to provide, against the payment,
I am undecided where to locate this *location_mentioned*League*/location_mentioned*, I am poor and unable
to improve it when located, and would if a fair offer could be had
sell it,   what is your opinion ?*/p*

*p*We get on slowly making out the deeds, the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*are fractious
and unprovided, the *person_mentioned*Commissioners */person_mentioned*fees are high, the *person_mentioned*Surveyors */person_mentioned*not
being able to get half their pay are hostile and untractable, much
praise is due to*person_mentioned* Mr. Byrd Lockhart */person_mentioned*for his forbearance and exertions
in the dispatch of business, and without him every thing would have
been por la obra de *person_mentioned*Dios*/person_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Col: De W.*/person_mentioned* is well and will save his
premium. I have heard that two of *person_mentioned*Martin de L's Sons */person_mentioned*are in
durance on the *location_mentioned*Rio Grande */location_mentioned*taken in their laudable exertions for
the extention of the Tobacco business, one of them is *person_mentioned*Dn, Fernando
Commissr elect*/person_mentioned* for his *location_mentioned*father's Colony*/location_mentioned*. Compliments and best
wishes for your welfare and happiness from *person_mentioned*Mr. Navarro*/person_mentioned*, the 
*person_mentioned*DeWitt*/person_mentioned*s *person_mentioned*Lockhart */person_mentioned*and those of your much oblig'd and obedt.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Josh. R. Bedford*/person_mentioned*    [Rubric]*/p*

*p*To *person_mentioned*S. F. Austin Esqre*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*N. B.   I enclose you a dollar and a half which makes us quits.—*/p*

*p*P. S. *person_mentioned*Mr. N.*/person_mentioned* thinks that the Communication in No, 18— of
*date_mentioned n="06-27-1831">27 June last*/date_mentioned* as coming from him and affecting indirectly the honor
of his friend *person_mentioned*Musquiz */person_mentioned*might have been better edited, the word
"declamation" is inserted for <hi rend="italic">"acclamation"</hi> and he is made to
sign himself Señor which appears to have been done thro' irrasion,
this is the liberty of the press with a vengeance.*/p*
