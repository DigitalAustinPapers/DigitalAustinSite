*p*Dear Sir  */p*                                                                            
*p*The situation of this place makes the Prospect very gloomy—the
*location_mentioned*Fort */location_mentioned*that we have been at so much Expence to build is about to be
left to the mercy of the *person_mentioned*Indians*/person_mentioned*.   I was up there a few days past and
the most of them talked of moving *location_mentioned*down the Country*/location_mentioned* and leaving
me on the *location_mentioned*frontier   */location_mentioned*some of them told me that you had promised them
Land if they would move *location_mentioned*down the Brassos*/location_mentioned*—but at the same time
some of them told me that if there was a *person_mentioned*Company of Rangers*/person_mentioned*
ordered on the *location_mentioned*Frontier */location_mentioned*that they would not wish to move and would
try to stay where they are as their places pleases them better than
any they Can git but that their Crops are albut lost this year which<barker_pb n="1392"/>
they intended to pay for their *location_mentioned*Lands */location_mentioned*with and if they do not get
Longar time to pay for them they will have to leave the *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*. .
I have never said nothing to them nor you on the subject but I do
think that those on the *location_mentioned*frontier of the Colorado */location_mentioned*particularly ought
to be favoured with Respect to payment of Lands as we have been
so much harrased and God knows when it will be at an end—I will
try to Come and see you on *date_mentioned n="08-05-1826">Sunday */date_mentioned*or *date_mentioned n="08-07-1826">monday */date_mentioned*if I am able I am
scarcely able at present to sit up but I think I am a little on the
mend . you will answer me by the *person_mentioned*bearer*/person_mentioned*—yours Respectfully*/p*
