*p*Dr. Sir,*/p*

*p*It is probable that the lapse of many years, and the necessary 
attention to business have effaced all recollection of even my name; I once
had however the pleasure of an introduction to you which I have
not forgotten, for public fame in your *location_mentioned*native Country*/location_mentioned* has so 
constantly kept you before me associated with every act of kindness of
encouragement and support to your former *person_mentioned*fellow citizens*/person_mentioned* that you
must needs be remembered— I have presumed to trespass upon your
attention for the purpose of introducing to your acquaintance *person_mentioned*Mr
Thomas Christian*/person_mentioned* who will hand you this letter. He is a *person_mentioned*native of
*location_mentioned*Virginia */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*and has resided for some years in this State in the 
peaceful persuits of a *person_mentioned*Farmer*/person_mentioned*—- I think I know him well and hazard
nothing in saying that in steadiness of habits in integrity and honour
he yields to no *person_mentioned*citizen */person_mentioned*of our *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*. His circumstances are easy
tho not affluent and he seeks in your *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*under a climate more
congenial an asylum from the cold of the *location_mentioned*North*/location_mentioned*— Such a man I
should regard as no doubt you do an acquisition to any *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*; and
any kindness or attention the generosity of your character may 
dispose you to show him or his *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*consisting of a *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and several
small *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*I am sure will be most gratefully felt and 
acknowledged— If you can spare the time to write to one so almost a mere
*person_mentioned*stranger */person_mentioned*it would afford me much pleasure— Every thing relative
to your *location_mentioned*Country */location_mentioned*interests me much particularly its <hi rend="italic">Government</hi>, soil,
productions, Exports, imports, climate, seasons, water etc and a
letter embracing these topics or some or any of them, or any other
would gratify me much— Be pleased to pardon this intrusion and
believe me to be*/p*
