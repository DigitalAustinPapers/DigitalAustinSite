years in all, two years on hire and one year him and myself worked
the *location_mentioned*mines */location_mentioned*in *person_mentioned*partnership*/person_mentioned*—there was nothing made of consequence
that year and I sent a full statement of the business of that season

pay him five or six thousand dollars. I wish you to get the *location_mentioned*Lead
