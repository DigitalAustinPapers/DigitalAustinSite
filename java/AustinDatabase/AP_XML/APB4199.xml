*p**location_mentioned*Lea Veo [Leona Vicario],*/location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="04-16-1831"> 16 april 1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*S. M. Williams*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dr Sir. I refer you to my letter to the *person_mentioned*Ayto*/person_mentioned*. and its enclosure,
where you will find as huge a monster as ever appeared in any
Legislative Hall on earth. I have endeavored to do all.I could
for *person_mentioned*Madero*/person_mentioned*, but nothing can be done with the present *person_mentioned*Govr*/person_mentioned*. I will
attend to this matter at *location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned*[with Terán] where more can
be effected than here. I wish you to write to *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*or get 
*person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*to do so and inform him of this.*/p*

*p*By the last mail I recd the *location_mentioned*pamphlet */location_mentioned*from *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned* which you
sent me, and the other letter. I have given no answer, and shall
give none untill after my visit to *location_mentioned*Matamoros*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have a letter dated *date_mentioned n="04-06-1831">6 April*/date_mentioned* from *person_mentioned*Alaman */person_mentioned*and one of *date_mentioned n="04-03-1831">3d. April
*/date_mentioned*from *person_mentioned*Teran*/person_mentioned*, all seems as well as could possibly be wished for.
The excess of tonnage duty paid by *person_mentioned*S. Rhoads [Fisher],*/person_mentioned* will be
refunded—*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will be remembered in regulating the *location_mentioned*ports*/location_mentioned*. The
arms of the *person_mentioned*Genl Govt*/person_mentioned*, are <hi rend="italic">wide open</hi> to receive us as a *location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*,
(but no basis is stated with the absolute precision which I think
necessary) agreeing in genl terms to the plan of *location_mentioned*Arkansas */location_mentioned*or 
something like it etc. The question of Slavery with the reasons which
I presented (some of which you have seen in my letter to *person_mentioned*Johnson*/person_mentioned*
of *date_mentioned n="03-31-1831">31 March*/date_mentioned*) has made a very great impression. I sometimes
shudder at the consequences and think that *location_mentioned*a large part [of]
America*/location_mentioned* will be*location_mentioned* Santo Domingonized*/location_mentioned* in 100, or 200 years. The
wishes of my *person_mentioned*colonists */person_mentioned*have hurried me into this thing—but I am
now in for the cuestión and there is no retreat, for my rule is to
go ahead after once coming to a decisive resolution on a matter of
such consequence as this.*/p*

*p*My health is not very good, this atmosphere does not agree with
me. I wish for a long life, for if these *person_mentioned*devils */person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">jalapize </hi>me, I have
a desire to live long enough to <hi rend="italic">Texize </hi>them with full interest.*/p*

*p*I have prepared a bill to amend the colonization law in the 
article which prohibits sales untill cultivated in totalidad, but I found
there was a desire that I should move the subject so as to destroy
the whole law and do all the harm possible. *person_mentioned*Jesus Grande*/person_mentioned* is at
the head of all the mischief—his *person_mentioned*brother Mariano*/person_mentioned* made a 
handsome fortune out [of] the <hi rend="italic">Salary </hi>he recd in a few months as *person_mentioned*vista
of the Aduana of *location_mentioned*Matamoros*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and now no doubt would find it to<barker_pb n="646"/>
be a very comfortable thing to exclude *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*from retailing
here so as to employ his capital to proper and honest advantage.*/p*

*p*I could have obtained anything and all I would have asked by
joining in this retail law—but better nothing than everything on
such terms.   Push the titles as fast as possible.*/p*

*p*Remember me very particularly to *person_mentioned*Father Muldoon*/person_mentioned*—I have no
objection to his seeing all my letters to *person_mentioned*Johnson*/person_mentioned*, particularly that
of *date_mentioned n="03-31-1831">31 March*/date_mentioned*, and of this date, also what I said to *person_mentioned*Williamson */person_mentioned*
relative to the evident necessity of never separating from *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*. I
have confidence in *person_mentioned*Father Muldoon*/person_mentioned* and in *person_mentioned*Teran*/person_mentioned*, tho time will
shew all things. He ought to be consulted as to the policy of
forming a *location_mentioned*territory of Texas*/location_mentioned*, and in doing so my letter on that
subject might be shewn to him by *person_mentioned*Johnson*/person_mentioned*, with a request that he
could give his opinion, in as much as it was a subject of great
importance and could involve the genl interests of the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*etc.
Tho do as circumstances may seem to indicate as the best.*/p*

*p*I have become responsable for all the fees on all the pe[ti]tions
sent on from *location_mentioned*Bejar*/location_mentioned*, *location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*, and shall have to
borrow money, and you must have some ready to send in *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* Bills.*/p*

*p*Remember [me] to all and particularly to *person_mentioned*Eliza */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Elizabeth*/person_mentioned*
and *person_mentioned*Arciniega*/person_mentioned*, tell the latter that I have attended to all his requests
read to him my letter to *person_mentioned*Johnson */person_mentioned*in full.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin  */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*

*p*I shall send two seals for the *person_mentioned*Jusgado */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Ayto */person_mentioned*by *person_mentioned*Powel */person_mentioned*and
*person_mentioned*Hickoke */person_mentioned*who start in a few days*/p*

*p*My colleague *person_mentioned*[Manuel] Musquis*/person_mentioned* is in favor of excluding those who
are merely *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*in transit. I would not have opposed that, if
the *person_mentioned*legislature */person_mentioned*had power to legislate on the subject, but I think that
the 50 Article of the national constitution gives that power 
exclusively to the national congress. *person_mentioned*Musquis */person_mentioned*is a man of sound principles
and unshaken integrity, he has made a host of bitter *person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*here
by his vote on the 1 Article and I fear will have an unpleasant time
in the permanent deputation.*/p*

*p*I think nothing ought to be said in the paper at present relative to
this law—or if anything is said, don't fail to compliment *person_mentioned*Musquis */person_mentioned*on
his vote against the 1 Article—on reflection I see no harm that can
arise from publishing the dictamen of the committee, and the names
of those who voted for and against—tho do as may be thought best.
It would be a very good opportunity to make some energetic but
 respectful remarks on the danger of violating the constitution, and on
the sacredness of that instrument etc—mention the thing to *person_mentioned*Wil-<barker_pb n="647"/>
liamson */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Luke*/person_mentioned*. I have sent a copy of the law to *person_mentioned*Alaman*/person_mentioned*, and to
*person_mentioned*Teran */person_mentioned*so that they may not attribute the results which may happen
from its publication in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, to any but to the true cause.*/p*
