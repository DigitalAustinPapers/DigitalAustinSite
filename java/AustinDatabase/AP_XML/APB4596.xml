*p*Austin to Samuel M. Williams, Mexico, September 5, 1833. Various reforms will be made in Texas.   Instructions for locating land.*/p*
*/div1*

*div1 type="body"*

*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="09-05-1833">September 5. 1833*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Sir,*/p*

*p*I am in better spirits as to the result of our *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*matters, than
I have been in since my arrival—a material change has been effected
in the minds of several leading men on that subject and I now think
that there will be no material opposition to the repeal of the 11<barker_pb n="1004"/>
article of the *date_mentioned n="04-06-1833">6th april*/date_mentioned* law. The duties I think will be suspended
in toto for one year at least and perhaps longer, or if this is not
done, there will be an important modification. I shall also succeed
fully in the alterations of the mails which I have proposed and
the 11 article of the april law will be repealed.*/p*

*p*I have confidence in the result which I now anticipate, because
this matter has been the subject of <hi rend="italic">much </hi>and very mature 
deliberation, and the conclusions which I think the *person_mentioned*govt*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*leading men
in congress*/person_mentioned* have come to, are therefore not hastily formed and
may be relyed upon with the more confidence for that reason. Upon
the whole I am of opinion that my trip to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-183">1833*/date_mentioned*, will do
as much, and perhaps more good for *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, than my trip in *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1822">1822*/date_mentioned*
did—the latter laid a foundation to build upon, the former [will]
raise the superstructure by removing the obstacles that have 
impeded its progress, and *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will then become a *location_mentioned*State of this
republic*/location_mentioned*, in harmony with the constitution and with the other states.
But should the <hi rend="italic">invaders </hi>succeed the aspect will be changed. Texas
has not much to expect from the <hi rend="italic">army </hi>or the <hi rend="italic">church</hi>. I have 
unlimited confidence in the *person_mentioned*vice President Gomez Farias*/person_mentioned*, and I think
that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will have cause to remember him with gratitude. Nothing
is now wanting but a meeting of *person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*to dispatch all favorably.
These matters were not sufficiently matured and understood, for
*person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*to act <hi rend="italic">safely </hi>on them untill within a week past, so that
upon the whole, the cholera has done no harm in preventing the
meeting of *person_mentioned*congress*/person_mentioned*. <hi rend="italic">There is nothing like patience and 
perseverance.</hi>*/p*

*p*The representations from *location_mentioned*Gonzalez */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Trinity */location_mentioned*published at
*location_mentioned*Monclova */location_mentioned*against the state, have had a good effect. I used them
to show that the people were disposed to submit to *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, and did
not wish to drive, or force measures, because they had confidence—
that *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*, would do what was right and just etc. I was told that
this confidence was not misplaced etc. remember that *date_mentioned n="10-xx-1833">October */date_mentioned*is
the limit for locating *location_mentioned*grants*/location_mentioned*—don't neglect that business. *person_mentioned*Don
Victor*/person_mentioned* is very uneasy about his business—-don't neglect it—he is
now a warm *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*—-don't forget *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Padill*/person_mentioned*[a's] [gra]nt*/location_mentioned*—also
*location_mentioned**person_mentioned*H. Austin*/person_mentioned*s one league*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I suppose that I am tota[lly] forgotten in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. I have only
recd, one letter from there since I started—that was from *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*
dated *date_mentioned n="06-24-1833">24 June*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*There are still some cases of cholera tho. not many—my health
is good—write to *person_mentioned*Perry */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Phillips */person_mentioned*the contents of this and 
remember me to all persons, for I wish well to everybody in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. A*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I refer you to my letter to the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
