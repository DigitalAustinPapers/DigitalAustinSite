*p**location_mentioned*San Felipe */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="08-28-1830">August 28, 1830*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Mr. E. R. Wigh[t]man*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Dr Sir. *person_mentioned*Mr Seth Ingram*/person_mentioned* is interested in a *location_mentioned*league */location_mentioned*which is to be
laid off *location_mentioned*back of his brothers league*/location_mentioned*, or in case of a vacancy *location_mentioned*below
the tracts that are taken on the west side of Prairie Creek*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*You must use your own discretion and exercise your own 
judgement in laying off these, and all the tracts in that *location_mentioned*quarter*/location_mentioned*, as I wrote
you the other day— the main object is not to leave *location_mentioned*vacancies*/location_mentioned*, and
also to run the tracts so as to make them as nearly equal as possible
in point of local advantages—.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr Nelson*/person_mentioned* writes me that his location was on the *location_mentioned*East side of
Prairie Creek and not on the west side*/location_mentioned*— I understood you that his
selection was on the *location_mentioned*west*/location_mentioned*— but if a mistake has been made you can
rectify it, for it is quite immaterial which side *person_mentioned*Nelson */person_mentioned*takes his
land— you will however be particular to try and make *person_mentioned*Fisher*/person_mentioned*s a
good league, which is *location_mentioned*the first one below *person_mentioned*Peyton */person_mentioned*on the East side of
Prairie Creek*/location_mentioned*, as I wrote you in my last—*/p*

*p*My Dear Sir I must rely entirely on you to do as near equal justice
to all as possible, for it is impossible for me to say how the tracts
ought to run, because this will depend on the shape of the *location_mentioned*Bay Shore*/location_mentioned*
and the direction of the *location_mentioned*creeks*/location_mentioned*, which can only be asertained by
actual measurement*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*

*p*A *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*who lives at *location_mentioned*Buckners */location_mentioned*is to have a quarter on *location_mentioned*Cany*/location_mentioned*
after the quarters for *person_mentioned*Maria*/person_mentioned*, and your *person_mentioned*sister*/person_mentioned*, are taken out— See
*person_mentioned*Buckner */person_mentioned*on the subject—so as to have it all fully understood.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
*p*Dr Sir*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Jaques*/person_mentioned* goes down to attend to the surveying of his tract-
he is to get *location_mentioned*the first tract west of Prarie creek below *person_mentioned*Peyton*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned* as I
wrote you the other day—¦ *person_mentioned*Mr. Nelson*/person_mentioned* wrote me that his choice was
on *location_mentioned*the east side below *person_mentioned*Fisher*/person_mentioned*s—*/location_mentioned* I am particularly anxious that
*person_mentioned*Jaques */person_mentioned*and*location_mentioned* *person_mentioned*Fisher*/person_mentioned*s tracts*/location_mentioned* should be laid off to the best advantage*/p*
