*p*Peter W, Grayson to James F. Perry, July 25, 1834. Concerning his mission to Mexico in behalf of Austin.*/p*
*/div1*

*div1 type="body"*

*p*At. *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Bell*/person_mentioned*s */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="07-25-1834">Monday morning July 25, 1834*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*D Sir,*/p*

*p*I enclose you a letter from *person_mentioned*Mr. Jack*/person_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*S. Fellipe*/location_mentioned* to *person_mentioned*Mr. 
McKinney*/person_mentioned*—It contains some important information in regard to affairs<barker_pb n="1086"/>
in the *location_mentioned*interior*/location_mentioned*-—An open falling out between*person_mentioned* S. Anna*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Congress*/person_mentioned*—
But what I wish to call your attention to in the letter, is that part
of it which speaks of *person_mentioned*Mr. Almonte*/person_mentioned* being in *location_mentioned*S. Fellipe*/location_mentioned*, and his
opinions in regard to *person_mentioned*Colo Austin*/person_mentioned*— The business of this *person_mentioned*Gentleman*/person_mentioned*
in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, as he says himself—was to learn the actual condition of
things here, the feelings of the people etc. The *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*
according to his statement, had been receiving contradictory rumors in
relation to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*for a good while, some representing it preparing
for rebellion, and others again contradicting all this— It appears
he is well pleased with the appearance of things, and says he will
make favorable representations to the *person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*.— and gives
it as his opinion that *person_mentioned*Colo. Austin*/person_mentioned* will soon be released—*/p*

*p*This appears to put rather a <hi rend="italic">new face</hi> upon the subject—so much
so, that I have thought, you and others might be inclined to think
perhaps, that the trip of *person_mentioned*Jack */person_mentioned*and myself might be <hi rend="italic">unnecessary</hi>—
For myself I scarcely know what to think—the distractions in the
*location_mentioned*Interior */location_mentioned*make all judgment no better than <hi rend="italic">guessing</hi>-— In such a
state of things I am <hi rend="italic">doubtful </hi>of everything, and as much of any good
we can do by going on as of any thing else—*/p*

*p*If the *person_mentioned*S. Anna party */person_mentioned*holds out a while, *person_mentioned*Almonte */person_mentioned*as he belongs to
it of course, will undoubtedly be able to do a great deal-— But if
the *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*goes down, perhaps his influence may go with it— But
of this we know nothing, and as I have said, can only guess-*/p*

*p*As you are about to incur more <hi rend="italic">trouble </hi>and <hi rend="italic">expence </hi>in this business,
than any one else I thought it well to put you in possession of this
new view of the subject, that you might reflect upon it and conclude
as you pleased— It would be well for you I think to hold some
talk with the *person_mentioned*McNeils*/person_mentioned*, and get the benefit of their opinions, as they
are pretty well qualified to judge of *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*affairs,—and by all
means see *person_mentioned*McKinney*/person_mentioned*, whose judgment on the matters would be no
less important—*/p*

*p*Besides you know he has taken upon himself a good deal of
troubles-—which he would of course think it well enough to <hi rend="italic">save</hi>.
if there be no real necessity for it—*/p*

*p*Whatever you may conclude on down there, I am certain will be
satisfactory up here, to*person_mentioned* Mr. Bell*/person_mentioned* and others-*/p*

*p*Do not think that I am getting reluctant or <hi rend="italic">faint </hi>hearted about
the trip, for I assure you I am <hi rend="italic">cheerfully </hi>disposed to make it if
necessary, and would be as ready to give it up, if those who are
more interested, in the <hi rend="italic">financial </hi>matters that relate to it should
advise in that way—*/p*

*p*Decide on the matter therefore, without the least regard to any
feeling of mine particularly for I assure you I am quite <hi rend="italic">easy </hi>either
way—*/p*<barker_pb n="1067"/>

*p*I think I can answer for *person_mentioned*Mr. Young*/person_mentioned* [and] *person_mentioned*Mr. Jack*/person_mentioned* in the same
way—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*P W Grayson*/person_mentioned**/p*
