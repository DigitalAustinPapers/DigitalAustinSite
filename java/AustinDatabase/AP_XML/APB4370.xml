*p*This *location_mentioned*nation */location_mentioned*is in a dreadful situation—it seems to be necessary
that they should pass through an ordeal—a kind of revolutionary
furnace, to purify them from the hereditary evils which unfit them
for republicanism—the present struggle is between the <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*democratic
republican federal party,*/person_mentioned*</hi> commonly called the *person_mentioned*Santana party,*/person_mentioned* and
<hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*aristocratic central party*/person_mentioned*</hi>. I think the result of the present civil war
will be the election of a *person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*who is <hi rend="italic">not a *person_mentioned*military man*/person_mentioned*</hi>, and the
organization of a *person_mentioned*democratic administration*/person_mentioned* for the next four years—
The *location_mentioned*port of the Brazo Santiago*/location_mentioned* and the city of *location_mentioned*Matamoros */location_mentioned*
containing about 10,000 *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*, were taken peaceable possession of on
the *date_mentioned n="06-25-1832">25 */date_mentioned*and *date_mentioned n="06-28-1832">28 June*/date_mentioned* by *person_mentioned*Col. José Antonio Mexia*/person_mentioned*, The old *person_mentioned*garrison*/person_mentioned*
quietly marched off one way and the others marched in—not one drop
of blood has been shed, nor one cent of private property lost or 
interfered with. No *person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*here, not even *person_mentioned*naturalized citizens*/person_mentioned*, have
taken any part whatever, tho that will not prevent them from being
unjustly censured by the other *person_mentioned*party*/person_mentioned*, who would no doubt be well
satisfied to see them all expelled the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Mexia */person_mentioned*came from
*location_mentioned*Tampico */location_mentioned*by water. The result of his expedition is doubtfull for it
is said that *person_mentioned*Genl. Teran*/person_mentioned* is near with his *person_mentioned*troops*/person_mentioned*—those who left here
expected to meet him—*person_mentioned*Mexia */person_mentioned*has about two hundred and fifty<barker_pb n="807"/>
*person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*. His conduct so far has been very correct and highly honorable
to him as a *person_mentioned*soldier */person_mentioned*and as a man. The *person_mentioned*Governor of the State
of Tamaulipas, Don Vital Fernandez*/person_mentioned* accompanied *person_mentioned*Mexia */person_mentioned*from 
*location_mentioned*Tampico*/location_mentioned*, where the events of the revolution forced him to seek refuge
from the *person_mentioned*aristocratic party*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
