<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-02-1826">October 2 1826</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Genl Humphry Fullerton</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>Dr Sir, I was truly gratified to learn by your letter to <person_mentioned>Major
Burnett</person_mentioned> that you had arrived at home safe in <date_mentioned n="07-xx-1826">July</date_mentioned>, that your health
was improving and that you had received applications from near
one hundred <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>who wished to emigrate to this <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>, and
more were daily applying—</p>

<p>The forty <person_mentioned>swiss families</person_mentioned> you speak of from <location_mentioned>Vevey </location_mentioned>will be 
valuable acquisition as <person_mentioned>cultivators of the vine</person_mentioned>, a species of culture which
I have no doubt will succeed well and yield great profits in 
proportion to the Capital and labor employed. The climate and soil are
said, by those who profess themselves <person_mentioned>judges</person_mentioned>, to be well adapted
to the cultivation of the vine, we cannot decide from actual 
experiments for none of consequence have been made—wild grapes are
very abundant in sandy soils throughout the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and of a good
quality, well flavored.—</p>

<p>It is important that you should send on as soon as possible a
list of the <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>who are coming on stating the name of the <person_mentioned>head
of the family</person_mentioned>, age, where born, <location_mentioned>last place of residence</location_mentioned>, wheither
<person_mentioned>married </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>single</person_mentioned>, number of male and female <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>, ages, number
of <person_mentioned>hirelings</person_mentioned>—occupation—age of <person_mentioned>wife</person_mentioned>—This list is necessary in
order to enter them in the records of the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>In regard to the fees I am as yet unable to inform you—The 
<person_mentioned>commissioner </person_mentioned>has not come on and I have received no final instructions
on the subject—I am certain however that they will not exceed
about four cents pr. acre including surveying fees and all charges
and six years will be allowed to pay a part of them. Such 
arrangements can no doubt be made with the <person_mentioned>surveyors </person_mentioned>in regard to their
fees as will make the payment easy</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>move very slow—and sometimes produces 
embarrassments and frequently disappointments and I wish the <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>
who are coming on to understand that I am not in any manner to be
accountable or censurable for embarrassments occationed by the 
delays of the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>—So far as depends on me their business
shall be promptly and faithfully attended to. we as yet have no
constitution for this <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>altho the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>or congress convened
to frame it have been two years in session—there is a prospect that
it will be completed in all this <date_mentioned n="Winter -1826">winter</date_mentioned>—The question as to the 
admission of slavery is undecided tho I think it probable that the 
unrestricted admission of slavery will not be permitted—those now in
the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>will probably be held as <person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned>for life, what will be done
with their <person_mentioned>descendants </person_mentioned>is doubtfull</p><barker_pb n="1470"/>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>of the <location_mentioned>old Colony</location_mentioned> I expect will be here in all
this <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1826">month </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="11-xx-1826">next </date_mentioned>in company with that of the new one; and as soon
as the affairs of the <location_mentioned>former </location_mentioned>are finally closed the surveys of the <location_mentioned>latter</location_mentioned>
will commence and not before, by that time the list of <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>above
spoken of can be sent on and the land laid off for them—</p>

<p>I am in very bad health which must be my excuse if I have not
written as fully as you wished—hoping to see you and the <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>
in the course of the coming <date_mentioned n="Winter - 1826">winter </date_mentioned>I remain</p>
