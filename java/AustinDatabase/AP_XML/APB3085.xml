*p**location_mentioned*San felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned* *date_mentioned n="03-10-1826">March 10. 1826*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Sir*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Chastellier*/person_mentioned* has drawn off copy of the Colonization law and
takes it with him—*/p*

*p*I very much regret that there should have arisen any discontent
among the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned* on the *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned* in regard to the manner of procuring their lands, every thing of this nature has a tendency to injure
the progress of the *location_mentioned*new Settlements*/location_mentioned* generally, and I would with due
respect to those *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*, and as their *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned*and the friend of all the
*location_mentioned*new Settlements*/location_mentioned*, recommend to them to be extremely cautious not to
do any thing of a violent or disorderly character towards the*person_mentioned* persons
intrusted by the Government*/person_mentioned* with the superintendence of those *location_mentioned*new
Settlements*/location_mentioned*—The utmost harmony should be cultivated—the *person_mentioned*agents
of the Government*/person_mentioned* should be treated with respect, and if causes of
complaint exist against them, representations should be made to the
*person_mentioned*proper authority*/person_mentioned* in a mild manner and without any thing like passion or abuse. These ideas are respectfully suggested to you in
friendship, they proceed from a sincere desire to see harmony prevail, and not from any disposition or desire on my part to intrude
my advice or censure on any person and I hope you will receive
them in the same spirit of candor and friendship in which they are
offered—I can have no object in wishing harmony, but the prosperity
of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, for my conduct in regard to receiving settlers will not
be regulated, or in any manner influenced, by what the other *person_mentioned*Empresarios*/person_mentioned* may do—my guide shall be the law and the orders of the
*person_mentioned*Government*/person_mentioned*, and the price which the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*may direct me to
exact of the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned* to pay the expences on their lands, is what must
be paid: how much that will be, I cannot tell untill instructions are
recd on the subject—I have applied for them and such instructions
and shall do nothing in regard to the final location of *person_mentioned*new Settlers*/person_mentioned*
untill they arrive.*/p*

*p*My *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned* who starts to *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned* in a few days will take on a
report of the history and observations made by me at *location_mentioned*Galveston*/location_mentioned* preparatory to the opening of the *location_mentioned*port*/location_mentioned*, and in all pro[ba]bility some
definitive measures will be adopted by the Govt in regard to the
establishment of a *location_mentioned*port town*/location_mentioned*, either at *location_mentioned*Galveston*/location_mentioned*, or *location_mentioned* some other
convenient point on thecoast*/location_mentioned*, during the ensuing *date_mentioned n="Summer - 1826">summer */date_mentioned*or *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1826">fall*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*I shall at all times be happy to hear from you and of the increasing prosperity of the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned* in your *location_mentioned*quarter of the country*/location_mentioned**/p*
