*p**location_mentioned*Matagorda */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="01-20-1833">Jan. 20th 1833*/date_mentioned*.*/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Colo. Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*Sir, Your letter of the *date_mentioned n="01-14-1833">14th inst*/date_mentioned*., was handed me <hi rend="italic">late</hi>, *date_mentioned n="01-19-1833">last 
evening*/date_mentioned*. Of the letter which you mention, as having been written from
*location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned*, I know nothing; never having seen, or heard, of such a
letter, till I perused yours from *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned*, of the date above quoted.
As to the letter from <hi rend="italic">this </hi>place, of which you speak, as having seen
at *location_mentioned*La Bahia*/location_mentioned*, and which you say you "burnt;" unless it was one
written by myself, signed by me, and <hi rend="italic">no </hi>one else, addressed to Mess.
*person_mentioned*Leving*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Morehouse*/person_mentioned*, and other *person_mentioned*Americans*/person_mentioned*, resident, as transient, in
that place, I must also remark, that I know nothing. If it was my
letter which you saw, and which you "burnt," as it was addressed
to <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the americans there, it became, as soon as received by them,
their <hi rend="italic">common </hi>property, and if they thought proper to destroy it,
the act of doing so, furnishes no just cause of complaint on <hi rend="italic">my </hi>part.*/p*<barker_pb n="916"/>

*p*I have only to regret, that, as it may be called in question at a
future day, and that, as the letter <hi rend="italic">itself</hi>, in such event, would be
more <hi rend="italic">true </hi>to the motives of its *person_mentioned*author*/person_mentioned*, better evidence of its tendency
to prevent, or to promote discord, than the confused, or the 
perverted recollection of fallible and mutable man, its preservation,
without doing an injury to <hi rend="italic">any </hi>one, might have served hereafter, as
a shield to the *person_mentioned*writer*/person_mentioned*, against the iliberal and censorious attacks of
more than one man, in times of high excitement.*/p*

*p*The letter was ocasioned in part only, by the threat and visitation
of the *person_mentioned*pretended collector of *location_mentioned*Goliad*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, to this town, for the avowed
purpose, of collecting duties, searching for, and seizing goods, said
to be deposited in the *location_mentioned*warehouses of this place*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*It was occasioned <hi rend="italic">principally</hi>, by an occurrence which transpired
previous to the communication of that threat.*/p*

*p*The rights of an *person_mentioned*American citizen*/person_mentioned*—of <hi rend="italic">one </hi>who had violated no
law;—rights, the protection of which, had been solemnly guarranted
by treaty—had been invaded, insulted, spit upon, and 
contemptuously trampled in the mud. In doing this, the <hi rend="italic">rites</hi>—the sacred
rites, of even savage hospitality, had been denied and insultingly
refused. Divested of his arms—his papers—travelling apparel; 
forcible possession taken of his horse, and thus deprived, for a time, of
the means of transporting himself to any *location_mentioned*christian habitation*/location_mentioned*—
oppressed by disease; weak, and emaciated, suffering the paroxism
of a fever, he was thus detained for hours in the *location_mentioned*open prairie*/location_mentioned*, in a
state of painful suspense which none can know who have not felt it;
and which, it is sincerely hoped, may <hi rend="italic">never never</hi> again be felt, even
by a *person_mentioned*barbarian*/person_mentioned*, in a <hi rend="italic">land </hi>professing Christianity, and calling itself
civilized. Treated as an *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">indian</hi>*/person_mentioned*, and <hi rend="italic">told </hi>that he was <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, put in
charge of beings, far less humane than the *person_mentioned*Arab of America*/person_mentioned*, he was
made to suffer the double torment of present deprivation and Misery,
and a threatening prospect of the future, if possible, still More
alarming*/p*.

*p*These are some of the amiable proceedings, these are a <hi rend="italic">part </hi>of the
tantalizing and disgraceful doings of <hi rend="italic">Men</hi>, calling themselves*person_mentioned* officers
of the law*/person_mentioned*, and *person_mentioned*guardians of the public interest*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*Oh, liberty! Oh, humanity! Oh, pity!! <hi rend="italic">When</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">why</hi>, did the
thunder sleep? Why was it reserved, why permitted, a "law-
despising," unprincipled, and merciless banditti, thus to outrage, a
pupil, of the school of *person_mentioned*Washington */person_mentioned*?*/p*

*p*But to proceed—My object in writing to the*person_mentioned* Americans in *location_mentioned*Goliad*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*,
was, to let <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, and through <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, the selfstyled *person_mentioned*authorities of that
place*/person_mentioned*, <hi rend="italic">know </hi>the determination, the unanimous, the individual, and
the collective <hi rend="italic">determination</hi>, of the people here, in case of an attempt.<barker_pb n="917"/>
by them, to carry their <hi rend="italic">threat </hi>into execution.   I thought, that, by
doing so, the effusion of blood, Might be prevented.*/p*

*p*Furthermore—the convention, considering there was no adequate
power in that body, or <hi rend="italic">elsewhere </hi>in the *location_mentioned*county*/location_mentioned*, as we were then
situated, to interfere with the <hi rend="italic">cargo</hi>, consented, and recommended to
tax the flag <hi rend="italic">only</hi>; Not pretending to extend their authority beyond
the collection of the tonage duty.*/p*

*p*This was the basis, or foundation of the resolution taken by the
people <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; and if an observance of any part, or portion of the
proceedings of the convention, was either lawful or innocent, then
their proceedings were lawful, were innocent, were patriotic!*/p*
