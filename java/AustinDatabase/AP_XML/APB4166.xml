*p*By your official letter of the *date_mentioned n="03-03-1831">3d prest month*/date_mentioned* which came to hand
*date_mentioned n="03-09-1831">yesterday morning*/date_mentioned* I am informed of the doubts of *person_mentioned*Capt Fuller
*/person_mentioned*respecting the payment of Tonnage duties— The law respecting the
liability of tonnage duties on a vessel or vessels of a *location_mentioned*foreign nation*/location_mentioned*
or under a *location_mentioned*foreign */location_mentioned*flag is so clear as not to need comment. Knowing
as I do the desires of *person_mentioned*Genl Teran*/person_mentioned*, whose authority extends over all
the *location_mentioned*Custom houses from Tampico to the Sabine*/location_mentioned* to afford every
facility and convenience that he can to the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*inhabitants*/person_mentioned*
of this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, and that the permission of vessels to enter into the
*location_mentioned*Brasos River*/location_mentioned* as tributary to the *location_mentioned*port of Galveston*/location_mentioned* is founded in his
desire to benefit the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*, I do most sincerely hope that every
*person_mentioned*Capt */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*owner */person_mentioned*of a vessel trading to that place will comply with
the law and pay the Tonnage money. Should the *person_mentioned*Govt */person_mentioned*find that
vessels entering the *location_mentioned*Brasos River */location_mentioned*do not comply with the laws no
doubt exists in my mind that they will totally prohibit the entrance
of all vessels— The tonnage money must be paid and unless *person_mentioned*those
who trade */person_mentioned*to the*location_mentioned* Brasos River*/location_mentioned* wish to deprive themselves of the
benefits of the trade they must obey the Laws— I entertain a 
perfect belief of yr disposition to do justice in the discharge of your
duties in which I have only to add be purdent yet firm in the 
compliance of the instructions you have recd from yr *person_mentioned*superior officer Col.
Bradburn*/person_mentioned*— I shall put a notice in the *location_mentioned*next paper*/location_mentioned* on the subject of
yr apointment—   Tendering you mv considerations of respect etc*/p*
