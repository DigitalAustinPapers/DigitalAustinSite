one— The *person_mentioned*boys */person_mentioned*can have their fill of fishing, and in the winter

*p*I have conversed with him relative to the removal of the bodies
of our dear *person_mentioned*parents */person_mentioned*and I highly approve of their removal to a
*location_mentioned*church yard*/location_mentioned*— I think that the best place will be the *location_mentioned*church yard
at St Genivieve—*/location_mentioned* They were recognized under the *person_mentioned*Spanish Govt*/person_mentioned*,
as *person_mentioned*Catholics */person_mentioned*and there cannot be any objection to receiving them
there, or should the yard there be thrown open and uninclosed, I
should be in favor of taking them to *location_mentioned*St Louis*/location_mentioned*, of this you and *person_mentioned*Mr
P.*/person_mentioned* must be the judges but I am not in favor of taking them to
*person_mentioned*Potosi */person_mentioned*for the reason that the *location_mentioned*burying grounds*/location_mentioned* there are all on
*location_mentioned*private property*/location_mentioned* and may some day become *location_mentioned*common Fields*/location_mentioned*— I
wish you would consult *person_mentioned*Mr Carr*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Elias Bates*/person_mentioned* on the subject and

I look forward to many days of peace and enjoyment in this 
*location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*— I hope in a few years to free myself from all my debts and to
