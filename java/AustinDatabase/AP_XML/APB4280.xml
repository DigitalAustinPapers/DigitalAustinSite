*p**date_mentioned n="11-17-1831">Nov: 17,1831*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear *person_mentioned*Cousin*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*I wrote you a scrawl some days since, (I do not recollect the date)
when I was quite debilitated, and with rather a feverish brain, and
really have no clear recollection of the contents of my letter, but<barker_pb n="705"/>
doubt whether I answered all the inquiries contained in yours of *date_mentioned n="11-02-1831">2nd
November*/date_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I am pleased with the idea of some publication that will make
the world acquainted with *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, as *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and its *person_mentioned*inhabitants */person_mentioned*
deserve.*/p*

*p*When I explored this *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1821">1821*/date_mentioned*, it was a wild, howling,
interminable solitude *location_mentioned*from Sabine to Bexar*/location_mentioned*. The *person_mentioned*civilized 
population*/person_mentioned* had not extended *location_mentioned*beyond the margins of the Sabine*/location_mentioned* in that
quarter; and was confined, on the *location_mentioned*west */location_mentioned*to the towns or villages of *location_mentioned*Bexar*/location_mentioned*
and *location_mentioned*La Bahia */location_mentioned*(the latter is now called *location_mentioned*Goliad*/location_mentioned*) which were *location_mentioned*isolated
military posts*/location_mentioned*. I found the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*so much more valuable than
I expected that the idea of contributing to fill it with a civilized
and industrious population filled my soul with enthusiasm. I can
with truth, and with a clear conscience, say, that none of the sordid
and selfish motives which influence the mass of *person_mentioned*adventure[r]s*/person_mentioned* had
any weight in determining me to attack this *location_mentioned*wilderness*/location_mentioned*. I 
commenced on the solid basis of sound and philanthropic intentions,
and of undeviating integrity. I asked the <hi rend="italic">favor </hi>of the new 
government of *location_mentioned*Mexico*/location_mentioned*—that is, <hi rend="italic">permission </hi>to settle this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and 
become one of its *person_mentioned*citizens*/person_mentioned*. What I asked was granted. I became
a *person_mentioned*Mexican Citizen*/person_mentioned*. From that moment, honor, the sanctity of an
oath, gratitude—all bound me to *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and her interests. Never
have I for one moment, deviated from the line of duty which those
obligations imposed on me. And, I attribute my success (for I may
say with pride I have been successful) to this circumstance. Should
this *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*ever attempt to trample upon us, however, honor,
duty, justice, the approbation of all good people of all good *location_mentioned*Nations*/location_mentioned*,
will point out the course for us to adopt. But, I have no fears—
not the most distant of such an unhappy event. But few of my
*person_mentioned*native countrymen*/person_mentioned* understand me, my character, motives, or 
principles. An earnest desire to benefit <hi rend="italic">all</hi>; in short, more good will,
and confidence in mankind than [was] deserved, have often led
me into mistakes verging on weakness, and exposed me to the 
impositions of the crafty and designing.*/p*

*p*A thorough knowledge of the *person_mentioned*Mexican */person_mentioned*character, the policy of
the Government and the feelings of the *person_mentioned*mass of the people */person_mentioned*towards
*person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*convinced me at an early day that *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*must be settled
<hi rend="italic">silently</hi>, or not at all. Hence it is that I was progressing here for
years, and rearing a flourishing settlement in this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and it
was unknown even in parts of *location_mentioned*Louisiana*/location_mentioned*, the adjoining State, that
such a thing existed. The circumstances are now changed, and it
is time to bring out my <hi rend="italic">ward </hi>and introduce her to the world.*/p*

*p*The emigration of *person_mentioned*North Americans*/person_mentioned* is now <hi rend="italic">totally prohibited.</hi> I
wish to start an emigration of *person_mentioned*English*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Irish*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Scotish*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*German*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Swiss*/person_mentioned*,
*person_mentioned*French*/person_mentioned*, any *person_mentioned*civilized people*/person_mentioned*; the three first are the best from the<barker_pb n="706"/>
unity of languages, similarity of character etc: A work on *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*
would do much good in *location_mentioned*Europe */location_mentioned*especially in *location_mentioned*Great Britan*/location_mentioned* I think
a little exertion would set in motion an *person_mentioned*English */person_mentioned*emigration of 
respectability, and as I am authoiized, in company with another, to
introduce eight hundred *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Europeans*/person_mentioned*, besides my former
contracts, I feel a great interest on this subject- I have no <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*North
American*/person_mentioned* prejudice</hi> against the *person_mentioned*English*/person_mentioned*, on the contrary I only 
remember that <hi rend="italic">our *person_mentioned*ancestors */person_mentioned*were *person_mentioned*English*/person_mentioned*</hi>.*/p*

*p*There is a *person_mentioned*gentleman */person_mentioned*here from *location_mentioned*Virginia */location_mentioned**person_mentioned*Doctor Branch T Archer
of Richmond*/person_mentioned*, a *person_mentioned*relation of the Congress [man] Archer*/person_mentioned*, with whose
character you are no doubt acquainted. He arrived in *date_mentioned n="07-xx-1831">July*/date_mentioned*, and
talks of writing a history of us, and has been to *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*collecting
materials relating to the *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*generally.*/p*

*p*As soon as I can I will try to spend some time with you at *location_mentioned*Bolivar*/location_mentioned*,
and will give you all the information I can. After I have seen *person_mentioned*Gen :
Terran*/person_mentioned* I can form a more certain opinion of the future policy of
the Government, and shall be better able to answer the proposed
queries of the " *person_mentioned*British Geographical society"*/person_mentioned* —certainly with more
satisfaction than at present.*/p*

*p*I shall not leave for *location_mentioned*Saltillo */location_mentioned*until I am fully restored in strength,
which will not probably be sooner than *date_mentioned n="02-01-1832">1st February.*/date_mentioned* This will
give me a week to spend with you for this reason I omit many
things I have to say until then. I rode out *date_mentioned n="11-16-1831">yesterday */date_mentioned*in a carriage
the first time I have left my room. In a week I hope to be at
*location_mentioned*Anahuac*/location_mentioned*, and if I can hire a boat will go thence to *location_mentioned*Chocolate */location_mentioned*and
then to *location_mentioned*Bolivar*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I am a houseless *person_mentioned*bachelor */person_mentioned*and have no accomodations to offer
you, but my *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*can furnish you a room in a *location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Texas Cabin</hi>*/location_mentioned*—with
*location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*fare—and an affectionate welcome. Hope promises better
things for next year, though as for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, a tree, or a tent, with 
blankets and plenty of fat wild meat—, I am satisfied.*/p*

*p*I congratulate *person_mentioned*Henry */person_mentioned*on the near prospect of seeing his *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*.
We have been scattered before the four winds of Heaven. *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*
will bring our dispersed *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*together, and afford us competence,
and—a*location_mentioned* <hi rend="italic">home</hi>*/location_mentioned*.   To me the idea is truly grateful.*/p*
