*p*Austin to Archibald Austin, February 24, 1830. Advantages in Texas for Swiss immigrants.*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*.—It is a singular phenomenon that a *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*of *person_mentioned*Americans*/person_mentioned*,
almost in the infancy of our *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, should be planted on a *location_mentioned*foreign
soil*/location_mentioned*—there to establish our *location_mentioned*institutions*/location_mentioned*, speak our language, practice
our virtues, and cherish our religion. Although under a *person_mentioned*foreign
government*/person_mentioned*, it is impossible not to regard them as " bone of our bone
and flesh of our flesh," and to feel an honest pride when we see them
extending the influence of civilization and industry over a *location_mentioned*territory*/location_mentioned*
the most inviting perhaps on the face of the *location_mentioned*earth*/location_mentioned*, but hitherto, only
the abode of wild beasts and roaming *person_mentioned*savages*/person_mentioned*. We have been
favored with a letter from a *person_mentioned*gentleman long resident in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, from
which we make the following extracts :—*/p*

*p*<hi rend="italic">*location_mentioned*San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned*,*date_mentioned n="02/24/1830"> Fed. 24, 1830*/date_mentioned*.</hi>*/p*

*p*You ask me as to *person_mentioned*Swiss emigrants*/person_mentioned*. They of all others would be most
benifltted by a removal to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, The *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*is highly in favour of
*person_mentioned*Swiss */person_mentioned*and*person_mentioned* German emigrants*/person_mentioned*, and they would be well received. They carry
industry and peace wherever they go; and the *person_mentioned*Swiss */person_mentioned*in particular, would
introduce the culture of the vine, and the making of wine. It is the decided
opinion of some very intelligent *person_mentioned*Europeans */person_mentioned*who have visited this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*,
that its soil and climate are equal to the *location_mentioned*best wine regions of France*/location_mentioned*. We
have in fact every variety of soil, from the richest alluvion *location_mentioned*on the margins of
the rivers*/location_mentioned*, to the high and rich uplands;—-clay and sandy soils, and all possible
varieties and intermixtures of them, and also rocky soils,—level, rolling, 
undulating and hilly lands. There is a large portion of very black, sandy soil,
having a clay foundation of eighteen inches to three feet in depth, which is
surprisingly productive; and I perceived that land of this kind is covered
with an excessive growth of wild Grape of very superior flavour to any other
wild Grape I have ever met with.    Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, etc, will yield most<barker_pb n="337"/>
abundantly; and the crops are certain and less liable to casualties, than in
*location_mentioned*Louisiana*/location_mentioned*. Corn, Tobacco and Flax, have been tried with great success. The
*location_mentioned*upper part of the country*/location_mentioned* *location_mentioned*on the Colorado and Brasos */location_mentioned*is rolling and in places
hilly. It is believed that wheat will succeed well in that *location_mentioned*section*/location_mentioned*. None but
substantial and useful *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*are wanted or desired in this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*;—Not
as respects wealth, but as regards industry, moral character and habits, 
education, enterprise and perseverance.*/p*

*p*The prospects here are <hi rend="italic">very good</hi> for enterprise and industry. The natural
resources and wealth of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, in fertile lands, timber, pasturage, etc. are
incomparably greater than any *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*I have ever seen. Its climate is mild
and healthy, and it possesses abundant facilities for navigation, both *location_mentioned*rivers*/location_mentioned*
and *location_mentioned*harbors*/location_mentioned*. We need nothing which nature could supply, but we do need
population. We need *person_mentioned*agriculturists */person_mentioned*to develope the great advantages of our
soil and climate. It is the settled policy of this *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*to fill *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*
with an *person_mentioned*industrial population*/person_mentioned*, and to effect this object it has extended a
degree of liberality to *person_mentioned*foreign emigrants*/person_mentioned* which is altogether without a parallel.
This liberality extends to all the sacred rights of security of <hi rend="italic">persons and
property</hi>, which are primary considerations with all *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*; and also to every
privilege and indulgence which any reasonable people could ask.*/p*
