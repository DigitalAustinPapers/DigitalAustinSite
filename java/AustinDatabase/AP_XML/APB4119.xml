*p*Austin to Samuel M. Williams, Bexar, December 29, 1830. Political news.
Reconcilement with Nixon.   His policy of avoiding political entanglements,
*/p*

*p*[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex,]*/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Mr S. M. Williams*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*You know that my maxim has always been that truth and justice
would ultimately prevail. I have a gratifying evidence of this in my
old *person_mentioned*friend*/person_mentioned*, and then bitter *person_mentioned*enemy*/person_mentioned*, and now again my *person_mentioned*friend */person_mentioned**person_mentioned*George
A. Nixon*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*The occurrances of *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1825">1825*/date_mentioned* and *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1826">6 */date_mentioned*etc arose from the want of a proper
understanding of the subject and of the difficult and critical 
situation in which the true interests of the *person_mentioned*North American settlers*/person_mentioned* were
placed. They have seen and become convinced that the course which
I pursued has saved them, and protected their interests, and that I
had no other object in view. Men who are thus convinced can be
relied upon as *person_mentioned*friends */person_mentioned*and all old feelings should forever cease*/p*

*p*I have agreed that *person_mentioned*Nixon */person_mentioned*shall have *location_mentioned*a League in the coast colony*/location_mentioned*,
I have told him that he can have the *location_mentioned*second League on the West
side of Karankawy below *person_mentioned*F. Kellers*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned* it is the *location_mentioned*next League below
one selected by *person_mentioned*Smith */person_mentioned*for *person_mentioned*Winston*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned*, and is the same that I planted
the peach stones on when *person_mentioned*Ingram */person_mentioned*was with me.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*<barker_pb n="570"/>

*p*Should he not like this League, he can get anyone that is 
unappropriated in *location_mentioned*Bay Prairie*/location_mentioned*, or any where else—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F, Austin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
*p*[Addressed:] *person_mentioned*Mr. S. M. Williams*/person_mentioned**location_mentioned* San Felipe de Austin*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*[Apparently a postscript to this:]*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*wishes-to take on *person_mentioned*Borden */person_mentioned*and some other *person_mentioned*Surveyor*/person_mentioned*, and
if *person_mentioned*Borden */person_mentioned*can get a good job I wish you would try and get him
a place—also attend to the business for *person_mentioned*Dr Victor Blanco*/person_mentioned*, and do
the best you can. I am better pleased with *person_mentioned*Madero */person_mentioned*than I ever was
before—-the people here are more discouraged, and more in favor
of *person_mentioned*North Americans*/person_mentioned* than they ever were. *person_mentioned*Arciniega */person_mentioned*will come by
the 15 or 20—have new commissions for*person_mentioned* S. P. Brown*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Chrisman*/person_mentioned*,
*person_mentioned*Wightman*/person_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Borden */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Ingram */person_mentioned*after he gets clear of his 
difficulties if he ever does, and push everything, for you may depend that
next year will bring Muchos Cambios y trastornas [many changes
and disturbances] and we must be ready for them.*/p*

*p*I wish *person_mentioned*Perrys */person_mentioned*goods hawled up, I have some order to enforce the
collection of duties, on the ground that they came in after the
exemption law expired— the opinion here is that as little notice
should be taken as possible of the entrada y salida de buques
[entrance and departure of ships] and keep all notices of them out
of the paper and say nothing de oficio about them, if possible to
avoid it-- try and push the *location_mentioned*store house*/location_mentioned*, and have all ready by the
time *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*gets on*/p*

*p*Let *person_mentioned*Jose Carabajal*/person_mentioned* have my odd pistol—    all is satisfactorily
explained with *person_mentioned*Navarro*/person_mentioned*—   I sent you 200 signatures by *person_mentioned*Williamson*/person_mentioned*,
attend to that without delay-*/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Gasper */person_mentioned*wants the [word illegible].*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin  */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*
