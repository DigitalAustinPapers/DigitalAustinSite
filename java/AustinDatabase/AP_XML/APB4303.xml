*p*[December 29, 1831?]*/p*
*p*It is not difficult for the immagination to determine what must be
the future destiny of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. Should the *person_mentioned*Mexican Government*/person_mentioned* adopt
a correct policy as to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, it will form *location_mentioned*one of the most
powerful states of their confederation*/location_mentioned*, for under a judicious system
it would not be [to] the interests of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*to separate.   But should<barker_pb n="731"/>
the reverse of this, unfortunately be the ease, a speedy and total
separation will naturally follow as a matter of course, and an 
independent government will probably be the result. The permanent and
substantial interests of both *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and the *location_mentioned*U. S. of the North*/location_mentioned*,
would be promoted in very many respects by the establishment of
an*location_mentioned* independent republic in the middle ground*/location_mentioned*. Such a *location_mentioned*new nation*/location_mentioned*
would remove the line of immediate contact which now exist 
*location_mentioned*between the two great republics*/location_mentioned*, and do away with those innumerable
small incidents and vexatious causes of complaint and excitement
which always will arise *location_mentioned*on the border limits of large nations */location_mentioned*remote
from the *location_mentioned*seat of Govt*/location_mentioned*. Too feeble to be feared by either of its
*person_mentioned*neighbors*/person_mentioned*, it would opperate as a kind of sacred and necessary barrier
against the encroachments of either. *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*would form a *location_mentioned*compact
nation,*/location_mentioned* and under the patronage and protection of both the *location_mentioned*U. S.
*/location_mentioned*and of *location_mentioned*M.*/location_mentioned* could sustain a respectable standing unless it should
enfeeble itself by the system of *person_mentioned*negro */person_mentioned*slavery. By the existing 
constitution and laws this worst of evils is totally prohibited. Should
this wise policy be abandoned and *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*become what *location_mentioned*Louisiana */location_mentioned*is
the receptacle of the redundant and *location_mentioned*Jail */location_mentioned*delivered *person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*of other
*location_mentioned*countries*/location_mentioned*, it must from necessity have a prop to lean upon and
become dependent, as a*location_mentioned* *person_mentioned*slave */person_mentioned*state*/location_mentioned* it probably could not stand alone.
The annexation of such an extencive *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*to the *location_mentioned*U. S*/location_mentioned*. would be
a measure of such doubtful policy, that it would no doubt be opposed
by reflecting men from all the *location_mentioned*states */location_mentioned*and especially by the *location_mentioned*eastern
and Atlantic */location_mentioned*ones on the ground that it would endanger the *location_mentioned*union*/location_mentioned*
by too great an extension of *location_mentioned*Territory to the Southwest.*/location_mentioned**/p*
