<p>My dear Sir I avail myself of an opportunity for your place to
send you a copy of a <location_mentioned>Memoir </location_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Western boundary of the US
</location_mentioned>which I sent to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>and which I understand has originated
a negociation on the Subject— When I first proposed the purchase
I expected to have had through <person_mentioned>Col Bradburn</person_mentioned>, extensive concessions
in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but <person_mentioned>Bradburn </person_mentioned>has failed to perform his engagements and
as yet I have no land secured, at the Same time I was influenced by
the knowledge that If I obtained no land myself the success of the
plan would secure to you a splendid fortune promptly My <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
now write that a <person_mentioned>Special Mission</person_mentioned> has been sent to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>to treat
on this Matter and the<location_mentioned> papers of the US</location_mentioned> contain Many articles
Strongly in favor of the purchase I have no doubt it will take
effect in Some Shape or other-—</p>

<p>Now if there be any mode by which I could secure a <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>of good
<location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>in my own name I would thank you to point it out</p>

<p>By the terms of the grant of the privelege of Navigating this
<location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>we are authorised to Colonise any of the <location_mentioned>vacant lands on this
river </location_mentioned>but there are none vacant that are worth having or that can
be got at Conveniently— The <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>is not Navigable excepting in
<location_mentioned>high Water above Mier </location_mentioned>and the<location_mentioned> banks of the River</location_mentioned> below that
are occupied</p><barker_pb n="301"/>

<p>My own affairs go on badly My <person_mentioned>Men </person_mentioned>have all been sick nearly
three months and at the time when the boat might have been most
profitably employed—</p>

<p>I am now in treaty with the <person_mentioned>Merchts </person_mentioned>of this place to sell them half
this boat to be run permanently <location_mentioned>between this and the Mouth of the
river</location_mentioned>— if I effect this arrangement it will relieve me from my
present confinement and perhaps enable me to visit <location_mentioned>your part of the
Country </location_mentioned>if I do not effect it I shall take the boat to <location_mentioned>New Orleans
</location_mentioned>as soon as I can and sell her to close the concern— I regret 
extremely the misfortune you have experienced in the death of your
<person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>, it is indeed a severe blow to you under your present 
circumstances— My last letters bring me the Melancholly intelligence
of the death of My <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>it has been truly a severe year to the
<person_mentioned>family   </person_mentioned>God grant the next may prove More propitious</p>
