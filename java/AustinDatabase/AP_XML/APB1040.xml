since*/date_mentioned* and at your request I now address you. *person_mentioned*Brown Austin*/person_mentioned* started

same month he wrote to us from *location_mentioned*Natchez*/location_mentioned*— he had got there safe
and well and I expect he is with you long ere this. We are anxiously
looking every mail for a letter from him from *location_mentioned*Natchetoches*/location_mentioned*. With
respect to your sister and myself moving to that *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned* we have
not yet come to any determination. I have some thoughts of visiting
your *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned* and if I am pleased with it we may move there but I
have some Scrouples to surmount before, I can get my own 
consent to leave my *location_mentioned*native Country*/location_mentioned*, to leave the best Government in the
world for a strange *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned* and strange Laws causes cerious 
reflections, but perhaps on visiting the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned* and becoming acquénted
with your Laws and your Government Settles down on Republican
principles as there is now every prospect that it will I may become
reconciled to change *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*. I will now state to you our prospects,
with industery and econemy   I know we can make an independent<barker_pb n="1042"/>
living here but I never expect to be able to live here in affluence or
to make a fortune. I beleive it was before you left this *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned* that
*person_mentioned*Samuel Perry*/person_mentioned* and myself entered into *person_mentioned*partnership*/person_mentioned*—he had all the
capital I get the one third of the profets. We are still doing 
business, on the same footing, and we have made some money from a
rough calculation we made *date_mentioned n="02-xx-1824">about a year ago*/date_mentioned* I think I may safely
state that if a dividend was now made my part would amount to
from 8 to 10,000 Dollars in *person_mentioned*negroes*/person_mentioned* goods money and Lands, which
would be a tolarable start in a new *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*. *person_mentioned*Saml*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Myself*/person_mentioned*

will have to soon. I have not purchased a house yet as I dont wish

not fond of moving. Now I have gave you an Idea of our
