*p*Dr Sir.*/p*

*p*I fear that your detention in mobile will do some harm—you
know that in *date_mentioned n="08-xx-1833">October */date_mentioned*the time expires for locating *location_mentioned*grants*/location_mentioned*—have all
that attended to and take care not to forget*person_mentioned* Padilla*/person_mentioned*s. I have *location_mentioned*three
leagues out of his*/location_mentioned* which I do not wish to loose—also attend to my
title for the balance of my premium land.*/p*

*p*The cholera is abating but there has been no session of *person_mentioned*congress*/person_mentioned*
since the *date_mentioned n="08-14-1833">14 */date_mentioned*and it is expected there will [be] no business done until
*date_mentioned n="09-xx-1833">next month*/date_mentioned*.   It is said that upwards of 16.000 have died.*/p*

*p*The revolution is not yet ended. *person_mentioned*Arista */person_mentioned*has possession of 
*location_mentioned*Guanajuato */location_mentioned*and there are a variety of reports about the progress of the
*person_mentioned*Crusade party*/person_mentioned*, but I do not think they can succeed. The civil war
may probably be protracted sometime.*/p*

*p*I can say nothing definite as to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*matters—they are all before
*person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*but when there will be a session I know not—neither is
there any certainty at all, what *person_mentioned*congress */person_mentioned*will do as to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. I  have strong doubts on the subject.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Tadeo Ortiz*/person_mentioned* has been sent to the *location_mentioned*U. S.*/location_mentioned* by *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*on some
misterious mission, but what it is I cannot tell—some say it is to take
*person_mentioned*Poles*/person_mentioned*, or *person_mentioned*Germans */person_mentioned*or somebody else to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*to dam out the *person_mentioned*north
americans*/person_mentioned*—stop the *location_mentioned*mississippi river*/location_mentioned* with a dam of straw—he told
me he would be in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*in *date_mentioned n="11-xx-1833">Novr*/date_mentioned*. and I think he is friendly to the
people there and liberal in his ideas etc nothing of much interest has
transpired since my last—all is suspended by the cholera—all is
melancholy with <hi rend="italic">death </hi>and <hi rend="italic">civil war</hi>.   I am better but debilitated*/p*

fast as possible—no one can tell what is ahead.*/p*
