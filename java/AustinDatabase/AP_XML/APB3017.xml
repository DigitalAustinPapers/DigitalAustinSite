*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*Since my first acquaintance with you in this *location_mentioned*city*/location_mentioned*, I have had
the desire to emigrate to your *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*; but circumstances of a private
nature, and some pecuniary embarrassments, have hitherto precluded
it. Moreover, not having, had the pleasure of an interview, or
even of correspondence with you, I have been deterred by <hi rend="italic">what</hi>, I
have always denounced as falsehood and detraction. *person_mentioned*Capt. Zepeniah
Butler*/person_mentioned*, with whom I went to the *location_mentioned*river Brassos*/location_mentioned*, has expressed his
wish to become a *person_mentioned*citizen*/person_mentioned*,   from the just motives, which have ever<barker_pb n="1225"/> influenced me in regard to your character as a gentleman, and your
justice, as an *person_mentioned*officer of the government*/person_mentioned*; and not only, that; (though
a primary consideration) but the excellent quality of the soil, on
which your *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned* is founded.*/p*

*p*I perceive however, not withstanding your justice, and judgement
in managing the local affairs of your *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, some difficulties will
arise among the evil disposed, which being transported into other
*location_mentioned*communities abroad*/location_mentioned*, tend, (though but partially) I hope, (to injure your rising prosperity), and that of your great, and arduous
undertaking.*/p*

*p*I mean, if possible, to visit *date_mentioned n="Summer - 1826">next summer */date_mentioned*the *location_mentioned*settlement*/location_mentioned*, which
you have spent so much time, and money to establish, and flatter
myself, that, I shall find, that it even exceeds in every thing my
most sanguine expectations: but before that time, I sincerely solicit
you to write me, and transmit whatever inteligence you may deem
proper to communicate, or entrust to one, of whom you have had
so short an acquaintance.*/p*

*p*I forbear to write any thing relative to the abusive and vindictive
publications of a certain individual, as the papers containing them
will be handed to you by *person_mentioned*Capt. J. T. Field*/person_mentioned*, who is the *person_mentioned*bearer */person_mentioned*of this:
they are relative to the abuse of the <hi rend="italic">Buen gobierno del establecimiento</hi>.*/p*
