*p*[New Orleans], *date_mentioned n="06-08-1832">June 8, 1832*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dear *person_mentioned*Cousin*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*I can not go hence without writing to you, if but a line, at once
of adieu and welcome. I shall soon be on my way to *location_mentioned*Kentucky*/location_mentioned*,
while you I hope are not far from your cherished *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*. I rejoice
to hear, as by last accounts, that your health and prosperity are so
flattering and pray God that you may be blessed in all things.*/p*

*p*Our book is not out yet that I know of The late political 
disturbances in *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*caused such a panic in *location_mentioned*New York*/location_mentioned*, that 
everything was at a stand. I hope it will be no disadvantage in the end,
as they say it will not.   In the mean time all *location_mentioned*Europe */location_mentioned*is in commo-<barker_pb n="779"/>
tion with wars and rumors of wars cholera etc. Despotism is 
seeking its last vengeance in *location_mentioned*Spain */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*Poland*/location_mentioned*, it is to be hoped. In
consequence *person_mentioned*immigrants */person_mentioned*are thronging to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*. Where can
they find such an asylum as *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*offers? How prophetic were
your views! With you, I am heartily sick of the *location_mentioned*old world*/location_mentioned* and all
its doings—the great tyrannies and the little ones. Pray be firm
against slavery. I witness such cruelties as fill me with abhorrence
<hi rend="italic">of myself</hi> and my species. How I long for our peaceful and simple
and quiet life, where we will admit no debasing passions. I will
not aim at too much and I can not be disappointed. My personal
wants are few. My plan for a *location_mentioned*school */location_mentioned*is drawn up, but at the present
it shall remain in my escritoire.*/p*

*p*I can not forbear to give you an extract from a letter of *person_mentioned*Orville
Holley*/person_mentioned* about my work. He says, " I intirely agree with you in your
appreciation of *person_mentioned*Stephen Fuller Austin*/person_mentioned*'s character. He is to be
ranked among the *person_mentioned*founders of *location_mentioned*Commonwealths*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, intrepid, 
interprizing, benevolent and just—a man of sense and soul. I am not only
pleased, but proud to be friendly and respectfully remembered by
such a man; and it will be among the many grateful considerations
connected with whatever I may be able to do in the matter of this
book, that it may serve in some degree to promote his just and sacred
interests." He says he has half a mind to emigrate himself, 
supposing he could fix in some *location_mentioned*prairie*/location_mentioned*, where he could gather his own
eggs, and after learning the <hi rend="italic">bee business</hi> take his own honey etc., etc.*/p*

*p*I mean to return here in *date_mentioned n="10-xx-1832">October */date_mentioned*when I will arrange the details
for further operations.    I can not now regulate everything, nor tell
the moment of my going to the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*.    But I assure you, my [dear]
*person_mentioned*cousin*/person_mentioned*, that it will be at the first moment I am able, for there is
nothing I so ardently long for—   In the mean time the happiness of
being once more with my dear *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*will absorb me.    If they
were in *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and I with them, I should not have a wish.    My
health is very good.    May all happiness attend you—remember me
kindly to your *person_mentioned*sister */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*family*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
*p*Your *person_mentioned*cousin */person_mentioned**/p*                                                                 
*p**person_mentioned*M A H*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*Hubbard */person_mentioned*has his passport—He and *person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*are well—*/p*
