*p*The weather having detained *person_mentioned*Mr. Treat*/person_mentioned*, until this *date_mentioned n="12-20-1830">morning*/date_mentioned*,
Enables me to place your Coat under his Charge, and he promises to
see that you get it with as little delay as possible. The Cost of 
Making it, far exceeds the sum named by the *person_mentioned*Tailor */person_mentioned*to*person_mentioned* Mr. Perry*/person_mentioned*, which<barker_pb n="566"/>
was but $20, So much so that the *person_mentioned*Tailor */person_mentioned*only Charges what he pays
his *person_mentioned*journeymen*/person_mentioned*. The principal Charge is the Embroidery, which at
first was refused to be done for less than $35.— The work however
is beautiful and I think you can but be pleased.*/p*

*p*The Cloth was received from *person_mentioned*Mr. Perry's friends in *location_mentioned*Philada*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*. with
whom*person_mentioned* Mr, P*/person_mentioned*. wrote he had left $20.—to pay the Making which latter
has not yet Come to hand but presume will be sent. Refering to my
previous letter by *person_mentioned*Mr. Treat*/person_mentioned* I remain*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*J. P. Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*
*p*P.S.*/p*

*p*I also send you by *person_mentioned*Mr. T*/person_mentioned*. a late publication, by *person_mentioned*O. Halsted*/person_mentioned* 
Showing his new Method of Curing Dyspepsia for which secret he had
previously charged $50— It is without Doubt one of the greatest
discoveries of the age, being an effective Cure of a Disease that had
baffled the Skill of our Most eminent *person_mentioned*Physicians*/person_mentioned*, Medicine no doubt
having a most injurious effect, in most Cases, as any thing would
that tends to weaken the tone of the Stomach—I most sincerely hope
as I trust you are not troubled with the above worst of all Maladys,
but if so unfortunate, and the disease is very prevalent here, you
may rely upon *person_mentioned*Mr. Halsted */person_mentioned*Cure as simple as it may appear, and
will thank you to loan the book to*person_mentioned* brother Henry*/person_mentioned* whose health,
unless improved much since he left here, would no doubt receive
benefit, was he to apply the Method to himself with perseverance—*/p*

*p*I know instances here where persons have been so afflicted by the
Dyspepsia as not to be ablento attend to their ordinary business and
so far gone that a cup of black tea would require something to 
Correct its ill effects, recover entirely by *person_mentioned*Halsted */person_mentioned*Method, and a friend
of mine in that Situation gained 12 to 15 pounds in weight in about
three weeks time-.*/p*

*p*We are a long time without arrivels from *location_mentioned*Europe*/location_mentioned*, there is 
however a *person_mentioned*French */person_mentioned*Packet reported below, to have sailed*date_mentioned n="11-04-1830"> 4 Novr*/date_mentioned*—-and
hope to get the news by her in time to send with this—*/p*
