*p**date_mentioned n="01-26-1833">Jany 26 1833*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr Sister,*/p*

*p*I recd yours of *date_mentioned n="01-20-1833">20*/date_mentioned*— I scarcely know what to do as to the *location_mentioned*Little
rock*/location_mentioned* business. The whole truth as it and other matters [stand] is as
follows— I bought a large amt of *location_mentioned*new madrid claims*/location_mentioned* of *person_mentioned*G. Tennelle
*/person_mentioned*for which I gave him my notes—one of those claims was laid on *location_mentioned*Little
Rock*/location_mentioned* in company with *person_mentioned*O'Hara*/person_mentioned*— I sold all the *location_mentioned*claims */location_mentioned*to *person_mentioned*Bryan*/person_mentioned*
and gave him a deed— I took an instrument from him by which he
agreed to pay *person_mentioned*Tennelle*/person_mentioned*—that paper I left in his desk at *location_mentioned*long Prairie*/location_mentioned*<barker_pb n="922"/>
as I had no safe place to keep it, and it disappeared so that I never
saw it again— he transfered the *location_mentioned*claims */location_mentioned*to *person_mentioned*H. Elliott*/person_mentioned* and there is
nothing to show that there was any agreement between them— *person_mentioned*Ashly*/person_mentioned*
no doubt knows all about it and if he is an honest man will settle the
business right—-if he is not, it will be difficult to do anything with
it. I have paid *person_mentioned*Tennell */person_mentioned*over seven thousand dollars, I think,—also
I have paid *person_mentioned*Butler */person_mentioned*about six thousand dolls, all within two years
or nearly all— It will take about $4000 more to clear me of debt—
I have directed *person_mentioned*John Austin*/person_mentioned* to sell land for what it will bring to
raise $1600 for *person_mentioned*Hunter */person_mentioned*balance due on what was paid *person_mentioned*Tennelle */person_mentioned*out of
the *location_mentioned*store*/location_mentioned*— I did not wish to sacrifice land for I wanted to give a
large tract to each of your *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*—but it is all a folly I am only
worrying myself to death*/p*

*p*I certainly thought and now think that your removal to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will
make your *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*all independent which they would never have
been in *location_mentioned*Missouri*/location_mentioned*— * * * I have been offered 5 dolls an acre
for *location_mentioned*1000 acres joining *person_mentioned*Perry*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned* and I could get 8 by giving a credit on
a part—but I wished to go there and live *location_mentioned*along side of you*/location_mentioned*. If
however you are always holding up the dark side of the picture to
me, I fear that all my prospects of comfort will be ideal. * * *
The *location_mentioned*tracts you now live on*/location_mentioned* will make as good a *location_mentioned*farm */location_mentioned*or *location_mentioned*plantation*/location_mentioned*
as any in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*— It has a good situation on the river also—is in a
good *location_mentioned*neighborhood*/location_mentioned*—convenient to the *location_mentioned*sea*/location_mentioned*, to the *location_mentioned*river*/location_mentioned*, to *location_mentioned*market*/location_mentioned*
will do for stock and planting—takes in part of *location_mentioned*jones Creek*/location_mentioned*—has
plenty of timber and *location_mentioned*prairie */location_mentioned*I always wanted *person_mentioned*Mr Perry */person_mentioned*to settle
there, but could not get him to go and look at it— The place on
*location_mentioned*Chocolate */location_mentioned*will always be a good *location_mentioned*stock farm*/location_mentioned* and may be kept up I
do not see that you have had more trouble [or] even as much as
most of the *person_mentioned*settlers in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*—A new *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*cannot be settled
without trouble*/p*

*p*As to the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*being ungrateful etc. which you speak of—all that
is nothing— They are always in a fret about something—it is so all
over the world—one day they curse and the next they praise. In
the end they will be just and if I merit a reward from them, they will
give it—*/p*

*p*The *person_mentioned*settlers of this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* will never forget me nor be long 
ungrateful to me. Of this you need not have any doubt. A man who
has no *person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*is a contemptable being, for he is not of sufficient
consequence to excite envy or jealousy so that you may set your mind
at rest as to that matter— These *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*will never forget the man
or the *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*who has made their fortunes.*person_mentioned* Cousin Henry*/person_mentioned* ought
never to have moved to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*and I hope never to see another *person_mentioned*city
raised family*/person_mentioned* coming to this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*—he has the foundation of a
future laid, but I fear it will do him no good,<barker_pb n="923"/>
I am surprised to hear you say that we shall never live to realize
anything from my labors— Is it nothing to have paid off nearly all
the old debts—to have given a credit to the name of my *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*by
settling this *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*that will be permanent and honorable for ages
to come— Is it nothing that you are now permanently settled with
the certainty that your *person_mentioned*children */person_mentioned*will not enter the world penniless—
Is 5 dollars an acre for land nothing— a tract was sold a few days
since *location_mentioned*near *person_mentioned*Perry*/person_mentioned*s league west of the Bernard*/location_mentioned* for 1.25 for acre, and
not better land than his— you let trifles have too much influence
on you— a punchin hut, or an indian camp is nothing, a mere
trifle, when it is to be only a stepping place to get into a comfortable
*location_mentioned*home */location_mentioned*and *location_mentioned*farm */location_mentioned*for life— If I had the power of a magician to build
Palaces I would not do it, * * * but when I have done all I
can, you ought to have more consideration for my feelings, when
you know they are more sensative than they ought to be to get
through this rough world—  your *person_mentioned*brother*/person_mentioned**/p*
