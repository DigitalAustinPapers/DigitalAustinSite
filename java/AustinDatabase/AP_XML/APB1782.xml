*p*Austin to Elias R. Wightman, November 4, 1829. Advice concerning manufacture of salt.*/p*

*p**p*Mr. E R Weightman*/p**/p*
*p*Dr Sir*/p*,

*p*In regard to the *location_mentioned*salt lots*/location_mentioned*. I think that if you could lease to
*person_mentioned*Burnham*/person_mentioned*, and give him the previlege for a certain number of years-
say three or four or five, on condition that he kept the *location_mentioned*works */location_mentioned*agoing,
and at the end of the lease the *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*to be given up with such 
improvements and kettles etc as may then be on the place, without
binding him to any specific kind or value of improvements—The
main object is to start the thing now for the benifit of the *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*,
the *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*hereafter will be valuable, and it is better to give the use
of the *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*for nothing for a certain number of years than to sell-
also it is better to give the previlege to *person_mentioned*Burnham */person_mentioned*to keep all his
kettles when his time is out-— This is my opinion-tho you must do
as you think best or proper and either sell or lease as may be thought
by you best—*/p*

*p*I am ready at any time to give you a full power of attorney as
*person_mentioned*agent of the proprietors*/person_mentioned*, I proposed to *person_mentioned*League */person_mentioned*on my return *date_mentioned n="Summer - 1829">last
summer*/date_mentioned* to go immediately down and he promised to do so, but has
been in bad health— As soon as it is possible for me to do so I will
go down there and make a final arrangement and in the meantime
I will agree to any dispositions of *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*to actual *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*who im-<barker_pb n="281"/>
prove them, that you may make— The time has not quite arrived
to push that *location_mentioned*place*/location_mentioned*—there must be some more *location_mentioned*settlements */location_mentioned*and some
more wealth round*location_mentioned* Bay Prairie*/location_mentioned* and *location_mentioned*on the river */location_mentioned*and it will not
advance the place much to sell lots at this time, for they will get
into the hands of *person_mentioned*persons */person_mentioned*who will keep them merely for 
speculation and they had better remain in the hands of the *person_mentioned*proprietors*/person_mentioned*
than in any others. I am in favor of letting *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*go to actual *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*
who will improve them but think that the *location_mentioned*lots */location_mentioned*will be better in the
hands of the *person_mentioned*proprietors */person_mentioned*than in those of such persons as would
be likely to buy at a *location_mentioned*public sale */location_mentioned*at this time, tho I am willing to do
on my part whatever may be thought best—*/p*

*p*I have been greatly disappointed by the long delay of the 
*person_mentioned*Commissioner*/person_mentioned*— I do not expect him now for *date_mentioned n="11-25-1829">three weeks*/date_mentioned*—and I can do nothing until] he arrives.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*S. F. Austin */person_mentioned*  [Rubric]*/p*

*p**date_mentioned n="11-04-1829">Nov 4. 1829*/date_mentioned**/p*

*p*[Addressed:] *person_mentioned*Mr. Elias E. Weightman*/person_mentioned* *location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned* *person_mentioned*Cap. Burnham*/person_mentioned**/p*
