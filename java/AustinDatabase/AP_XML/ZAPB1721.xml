<p><location_mentioned>Brasoria</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="05-26-1829">May 26, 1829</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Sister</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>your last came to hand in 16 days after its date. I am happy to
hear of your health and that of your fine <person_mentioned>family of children</person_mentioned>—
I wish I was in a situation to take <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>, but I think that he will
do better for the present where he is, we have no good <location_mentioned>schools</location_mentioned>
here, I will accept of the offer you make of him as soon as I think
it will be for his advantage to come out here—</p>

<p>I am now at <location_mentioned>brother</location_mentioned>s who has settled at this <location_mentioned>place </location_mentioned>probably for life or at least for many years—he is quite in the woods as yet, tho
comfortable, and has a fine <person_mentioned>Boy </person_mentioned>as ever I saw— this place is <location_mentioned>20
miles by water from the Mouth of the river</location_mentioned> and about <location_mentioned>10 miles
from the coast in a direct line</location_mentioned> I think it will become a place of
business</p>

<p>It is very uncertain when I shall visit <location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>not this year—
I cannot advise <person_mentioned>Mr. Perry</person_mentioned> to [move] here, neither do I advise
him not to move, he cannot form any correct opinion on the 
subject without visiting the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and spending at least two months
to examine it—</p>

<p>My health is none of the best, tho the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>has been very
healthy this season, and we have the most promising appearances of
crops</p>

<p>I have nothing worth filling a letter with and therefore shall
wind up with the most sincere wishes for your health and prosperity
remember me to <person_mentioned>Mr Perry</person_mentioned> and all the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>and to <person_mentioned>Mrs John
Perry,</person_mentioned> she ought to take a trip to the <location_mentioned>coast of Texas</location_mentioned>—this is a
wonderfull prolific and fertile country and much pleasanter than
that frozen region—remember me to my old friend <person_mentioned>John P</person_mentioned>—and to
<person_mentioned>Saml</person_mentioned>. etc</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen   </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>there is no news of any Kind, this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>improves—the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
are satisfied with the Govt and we have universal peace and 
tranquility in all <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mrs Emily M. Perry</person_mentioned>   <location_mentioned>Potosi Missouri</location_mentioned></p>
