them, and take satisfaction for any outrages they may commit.*/p*

*p*The actual situation of this *location_mentioned*Establishment */location_mentioned*is by no means well 
calculated to meet the commencement of a war, owing to the reasons
already expressed in my communication of *date_mentioned n="08-20-1825">August 20th*/date_mentioned*, and 
*date_mentioned n="09-08-1825">September the 8th*/date_mentioned* to the *person_mentioned*Political Chief of the Department*/person_mentioned*. 
Nevertheless we are all ready to obey, and to attack any people considered
as *person_mentioned*enemies */person_mentioned*by the *person_mentioned*government*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

permit for either attack upon or defence against the *person_mentioned*enemy*/person_mentioned*. I have,
in fact, already ordered the *person_mentioned*militia */person_mentioned*to be in readiness to march at the
earliest notice, and I shall not omit to report to you any new 
occurrences.*/p*
