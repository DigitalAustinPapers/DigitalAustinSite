<p>Dr Sir.   This will be handed to you by <person_mentioned>Geo. Fisher, the Collector
of <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who returns to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>as an <person_mentioned>Officer of the Governt
</person_mentioned>to establish the <location_mentioned>Custom House</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have assured him, that he will receive the support of the 
<person_mentioned>Colonists </person_mentioned>in sustaining the Revenue Laws, and Collecting the duties.<barker_pb n="982"/>
There is too much good sense in the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">farmers </hi></person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">regular Merchants</hi>
</person_mentioned>in that <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>to suffer themselves to be envolved in difficulties by
transient <person_mentioned>Pedlars </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>Traders </person_mentioned>whose only object is to increase their
profits at the cost of those who may be weak or vile enough to aid
them.</p>

<p>As regards the Past, and any bad feelings which may have existed
about the transactions in which<person_mentioned> Mr Fisher</person_mentioned> was concerned—I think
they should all be buried in everlasting oblivion and forgotten.
"The Soveraign Mantle" of the <location_mentioned>Nation </location_mentioned>has been thrown over all
former excitements in every part of the <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>. The same should
be done in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and I have no doubt it will be, and that <person_mentioned>Mr
Fisher, as Collector of <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will receive the unanimous 
support of the <person_mentioned>farmers </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>regular merchants</person_mentioned>.</p>

certify.</p>
