<p>Sir We wrote on the<date_mentioned n="1-16-1830"> 16 Decr. last</date_mentioned> by<person_mentioned> Mr. Treat</person_mentioned> and to which we
beg leave to refer you. Our exertions have been great to promote
the interest of the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>but it is a work of so much magnitude to
get into operation, that we have not effected as much as we wish.</p>

<p>Our pioneer vessel sailed on the <date_mentioned n="12-29-1830">29th Decr.</date_mentioned> Another will sail in a
few days with <person_mentioned>Swiss </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Germans </person_mentioned>etc. for<location_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Col. Mexia</person_mentioned>'s Settlement.
</location_mentioned>Others we hope will be forwarded without much delay, if no 
untoward event occurs at <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>to check the effort to Colonize.</p>

<p>There is much may be done if your views and ours accord that will
aid us and add tenfold value to your <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>and increase the value
of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in every point of view, whether social, Agricultural, 
Political, or otherwise. We have engaged two <person_mentioned>Gentlemen </person_mentioned>as our <person_mentioned>agents</person_mentioned>,
who we hope will sail from here in a few days, and meet you at
<location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>, where our plan of arrangements for your and ourselves will
be developed and which we have no doubt you will consider for
your interest to engage in with us in endeavouring to carry into<barker_pb n="578"/>
operation.   We beg leave to commend to your friendly notice 
aswell the <location_mentioned>infant settlements</location_mentioned> we have sent out, as all others who may
hereafter arrive at <person_mentioned>Galveston </person_mentioned>and that may need your aid, counte
