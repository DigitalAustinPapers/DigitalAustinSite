*p*Editorial by Austin in Texas Gazette, September 25, 1830. Friendly disposition of Government toward Texas. Need of judiciary reform and separation from Coahuila.*/p*
*/div1*

*div1 type="body"*

*p*Letters have been received by a *person_mentioned*gentleman */person_mentioned*in this *location_mentioned*place */location_mentioned*from 
*person_mentioned*persons high in office */person_mentioned*and in the confidence of the nation. Their letters
express the most friendly and natural disposition towards this and
all other *location_mentioned*colonies */location_mentioned*or *location_mentioned*settlements in Texas*/location_mentioned* that have been legally 
established. Great solicitude is manifested in these letters for the
prosperity of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and for its advancement. They say in
positive terms, that none of the rumors which agitated public 
opinion as to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="Spring-1830">last spring*/date_mentioned* had their origin from this *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*; neither
has there ever been any unfavorable impression against it. These
rumors, they say, originated from a great mass of *location_mentioned*newspaper */location_mentioned*and
*location_mentioned*other publications*/location_mentioned* in the *location_mentioned*U. S of the north*/location_mentioned*—stating among
other things, that swarms of *person_mentioned*adventurers */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*fugitives */person_mentioned*from justice,
who could remain no longer in their *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, were about to overrun
and occupy *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. Such an event would have been ruinous to the
tranquility and prosperity of this *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*, and therefore demanded
the prompt attention of the government.*/p*

*p*It must be confessed that publications similar to that by "A 
revolutionary officer," and many others which contain nothing but <hi rend="italic">base
and infamous slanders</hi> were well calculated to ruin us, both in
*location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*and in *location_mentioned*foreign countries*/location_mentioned*. There is cause to suspect that one
of the great objects of these *person_mentioned*slanderous scribblers*/person_mentioned* was to stop the
emigration from the *location_mentioned*U. S. of the north*/location_mentioned*, or from other *location_mentioned*foreign
countries*/location_mentioned* to *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*. . . . They appear to have acted on the 
principle <hi rend="italic">to make *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*a part of the*location_mentioned* U. S. of the North*/location_mentioned*, or to keep it
down and consign it for years to the *location_mentioned*wilderness */location_mentioned*and the occupancy
of the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*by damning its reputation so that no Honest, wealthy
or civilized *person_mentioned*man*/person_mentioned*, would remove to it</hi>.   .   .   .*/p*

*p*We have in former numbers of the *location_mentioned*Gazette */location_mentioned*stated that the cause,
<hi rend="italic">and the sole cause</hi>, of any and all the little bickerings and confusion
that may have existed in *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, since *date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1821">1821*/date_mentioned*, have proceded from
the want of a proper organization of the *person_mentioned*local government*/person_mentioned*, and
especially of the *person_mentioned*judiciary*/person_mentioned*. In this respect a change is necessary,
and is daily becoming more so. It has become a matter of serious
doubt whether *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will ever rise or prosper, so long as it is united
with *location_mentioned*Coahuila*/location_mentioned*. The question of separating, with the view of 
forming a *person_mentioned*territorial government*/person_mentioned*, as a *location_mentioned*territory of this nation*/location_mentioned*, is 
beginning to occupy much of the public attention. This is a serious
question, and merits the most calm and mature reflection.*/p*
