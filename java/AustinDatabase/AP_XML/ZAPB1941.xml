your <person_mentioned>Colony</person_mentioned>, I have long Known these <person_mentioned>Gentlemen </person_mentioned>as <person_mentioned>merchants</person_mentioned>,
and from their General Character as <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>merchants</person_mentioned>, together

your powers to grant—</p>

<p>Such men as the <person_mentioned>Mess Sutherlands</person_mentioned> Settling in a new <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>
is well calculated to give character to the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, and draw after
them other <person_mentioned>Settlers </person_mentioned>of equal wealth and respectability, I am well
aware of the difficulty of a <person_mentioned>merchants </person_mentioned>winding up his business in a
<location_mentioned>Country like Alabama</location_mentioned> and have no doubt that <person_mentioned>Mr. Sutherland</person_mentioned> has
given himself as short a time to effect the object as he can do it in.</p>

<p>In order to more effectually prove to you his determination to
locate in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr. S</person_mentioned>. will this <date_mentioned n="Fall - 1830">fall </date_mentioned>build a <location_mentioned>House </location_mentioned>on the land
designated, and <date_mentioned n="Spring - 1831">next Spring put </date_mentioned>into Cultivation a part of the Land</p>
