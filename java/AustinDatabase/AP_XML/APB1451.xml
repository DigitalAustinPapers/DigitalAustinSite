*p**person_mentioned*Hon. J. R Poinsett*/person_mentioned*,*/p*

*p*Sir—¦ At the request of my friend *person_mentioned*Mr David G. Burnet*/person_mentioned* of
*location_mentioned*Ohio */location_mentioned*I inclose you two letters of recommendation, one from the
*person_mentioned*Hon. H. Clay*/person_mentioned* and the other from the *person_mentioned*Hon. E. A. Brown.*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Burnet*/person_mentioned* has obtained from the *person_mentioned*Gov't of this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*authority
to colonise a district of *location_mentioned*Country lyying west of Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned* and as
it is a small strip he wishes to annex to it a *location_mentioned*portion of country ex-<barker_pb n="1704"/>
tending East from said village to the Sabine river,*/location_mentioned* but as this latter
is embraced *location_mentioned*within the twenty border leagues reserved by the 
Colonization Act*/location_mentioned*, it cannot be colonized without the previous permission
of the *person_mentioned*President */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Mr. Burnet*/person_mentioned* has presented a memorial to that
effect which goes on by this mail to the *person_mentioned*minister of relations*/person_mentioned* 
recommended by this Gov't.*/p*

*p*His object in directing his attention to this enterprise is to settle
a number of reputable *person_mentioned*farmers */person_mentioned*from the *location_mentioned*State of Ohio*/location_mentioned*, who find it
inconvenient to provide lands in that *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*for their large and
increasing *person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*owing to its excessively high price. The 
morality, industry and agricultural enterprise which characterize the 
*person_mentioned*inhabitants of *location_mentioned*Ohio */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*are well known and proverbial, slavery is 
unknown amongst them, they are " principled " against it, every man
is a *person_mentioned*laborer*/person_mentioned*, and in this particular to their other recommend able
qualities, they unite a principle which is in strict accordance with
the broad ideas of liberty and universal emancipation laid down in
the State Constitutions, and so strenuously urged in legislative 
deliberations—*/p*

*p*The restrictions as to Slavery in this *location_mentioned*State */location_mentioned*present very material
obstacles to the settlement of *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*by *person_mentioned*emigrants from the *location_mentioned*southern
States*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*, and should it be the wish of the *person_mentioned*Mexican Gov't,*/person_mentioned* to convert
that fine portion of its *location_mentioned*territory */location_mentioned*from a *location_mentioned*savage wilderness */location_mentioned*and 
useless dead burthen on the *location_mentioned*nation*/location_mentioned*, to a populous, civilized and 
cultivated state capable of contributing a material quota towards 
national incomer wealth and prosperity, sound policy, and expediency I
should presume would approve of a decided encouragement of *location_mentioned*Ohio*/location_mentioned*
and other northern emigration. As regards national policy, I can
see no objection to *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*from our *location_mentioned*sister republic*/location_mentioned*, similitude
of political institutions, unity of genl interests, absence of cause for
a difference in local interests and enthusiastic love of liberty, present
natural and mutual guarantees of perpetual harmony and peace 
between the two *location_mentioned*nations*/location_mentioned*. Not so with the *location_mentioned*nations of Europe*/location_mentioned*, who are, and must ever be the natural *person_mentioned*enemies of *location_mentioned*American */location_mentioned**/person_mentioned*prosperity; and
besides, the kind of *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*that may be brought from *location_mentioned*Europe */location_mentioned*for
colonizing purposes will not be of the class calculated to advance the
*person_mentioned*lower orders of Society */person_mentioned*for the purpose of filling a contract, they
will not in general possess the enterprise, perseverance and morality
so indespensable to settle a wilderness, whereas *person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*from the
*location_mentioned*north*/location_mentioned*, to these and many other good qualities will add Capital—such
*person_mentioned*emigrants */person_mentioned*certainly cannot be compared with the overflowings of
the redundant population of *location_mentioned*Europe*/location_mentioned*—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr. Burnet*/person_mentioned* is in *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches */location_mentioned*and in obedience to his wishes, as
well as to comply with my duty as a friend, I have troubled you<barker_pb n="1705"/>
with this letter, and solicit such aid with the minister of relations in
favor of the application as may be consistent.*/p*

*p*I embrace this opportunity to present my warmest wishes for your
health and happiness and big you to accept the assurance of respect
and esteem with which I have the honor to remain
your very Obt. Servt*/p*.

*p**person_mentioned*Stephen F. Austin*/person_mentioned*—*/p*
*p*P. S.    Any communications relative to *person_mentioned*Mr Burnet*/person_mentioned*'s business which
you may think proper to make will reach their destination directed
to me " en la villa de*location_mentioned* San Felipe de Austin, Texas,*/location_mentioned* (por el *location_mentioned*Saltillo*/location_mentioned*)"*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Estevan F. Austin*/person_mentioned*.*/p*
*p**date_mentioned n="11-05-1827">Nov. 5*/date_mentioned*—I enclose copies of *person_mentioned*Mr. Burnet*/person_mentioned*'s petition and the "in-
forms " of the Govt.*/p*
