*p**person_mentioned*Colonl Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*Having heard of your *person_mentioned*expedition */person_mentioned*to the *location_mentioned*Isleland*/location_mentioned*, I made every
exertion in my power to join you there but failed in procuring a
conveyance untill I heard of your return. I then went to the *location_mentioned*bay*/location_mentioned*
by land a very unpleasant trip owing to the weather and rottenness
of the *location_mentioned*perarys [prairies]*/location_mentioned*, there again heard you was to leave *person_mentioned*Mr <barker_pb n="1270"/>
Scotts*/person_mentioned* on the day of my arrival there for home. Returning to the
*location_mentioned*trinety*/location_mentioned* I heard again that you was to attend a meeting at the
*location_mentioned*Santa Jacinta*/location_mentioned* on the *date_mentioned n="03-04-1826">fourth of March*/date_mentioned* ordered by yourself in order to present a memorial against me to the *person_mentioned*Government */person_mentioned*for asking my
*person_mentioned*colonists*/person_mentioned* more than the Government tax on the lands propigated here
in my absence by *person_mentioned*Mr Rankin*/person_mentioned*. This I placed no confidence in not
believing that *person_mentioned*Colo. Austin*/person_mentioned* could be capable of using any measures
to the injury of the other *person_mentioned*Empresarios*/person_mentioned* after having set the example
himself and reaped the fruits thereof, not only that; the people
who are to be the *person_mentioned*memorialists*/person_mentioned* have already obtained their lands
from yourself therefore can have no interest in the disposition of
my lands and I have never seen more than two or three of them
all of whom I informed might rest contented that there would be no
difficulty about their titles never calculating there would arise any
between us on the subject. As to my conditions I feel myself perfectly justified by that article of the law securing contracts made
between the *person_mentioned*settlers */person_mentioned*and *person_mentioned*Empresarios */person_mentioned*which article was inserted in
consequence of complaints made against yourself for selling the
*location_mentioned*lands */location_mentioned*and I feel myself more than doubly justified in asking what
I do for the good of the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned* and of the government in general,
as you must admit as a candid man that one *person_mentioned*colonist */person_mentioned*who is willing
and able to pay for the lands as offered is worth fifty of those indolent *person_mentioned*Iddlers */person_mentioned*who barely live to exist and have no ambition or
enterprise further. If you would do me the pleasure of coming to
see me I will show you that my *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned* are already engaged at my
prices and are unwilling that I should permit others to settle upon
less terms being satisfied of the disadvantages arising to the *location_mentioned*Country*/location_mentioned*
from such a coarse. The honest industrious already in the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*
are of the same opinion and have complied with the terms already.*/p*

*p*I am constantly told by those worthless *person_mentioned*Iddlers */person_mentioned*that *person_mentioned*Judge Austin*/person_mentioned*
gives lands at *person_mentioned*Congress */person_mentioned*prices and says we have no right to ask or
receive more. I have never payed any attention to their assertions
believing them to be fabrications only replying to them to get lands
of you. I have no doubt but there are hundreds of lies told you
perhaps in the same way in order as I have understood they have
said if the[y] could get the *person_mentioned*Empresarios */person_mentioned*at variance they would be
able to reap a benefit. I hope you will give me the earliest information of your discoveries to our advantage in your trip to *location_mentioned*isleland*/location_mentioned*
and should you be disturbed at any part of my conduct that you
will be candid enough to state your objections to me before taking
any measures unfriendly I expect to meet *person_mentioned*Colo. Leftwitch*/person_mentioned* on my
return to *location_mentioned*Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned* and should feel very happy [if] we could
all have a meeting to promote the best interests of the *location_mentioned*country*/location_mentioned*.*/p*
