*p*My dear Sir*/p*

*p*I wrote you two long letters by the last vessels to *location_mentioned*Matamoros*/location_mentioned*,
chiefly on my own subject. The main object of this is to acquaint
you with some propositions made to me here which I think may be
directed to the interests of the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*and also to your own. *person_mentioned*Mr
N A Ware*/person_mentioned* of *location_mentioned*Philada */location_mentioned*who has lately sold his *location_mentioned*plantation on this river*/location_mentioned*
proposes to invest forty thousand dollars in a*location_mentioned* cotton manufactory
*/location_mentioned*in the *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*, provided he can have permission to do so, a piece of
land for the establishment and your countenance and support to
the enterprise. He says *person_mentioned*Mr Boys*/person_mentioned* reports having obtained the 
exclusive right for *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, in consideration of establishing a *location_mentioned*cotton mill*/location_mentioned*
at *location_mentioned*Bexar */location_mentioned*which he is now going about. I do not believe this to be
true, you can ascertain. *person_mentioned*Mr Ware*/person_mentioned* does not propose to go out 
immediately himself but to send a confidential and experienced man to
erect the establishment, in whose name the location might be made.
I have told him I thought it probable yon would be much pleased
to have such an establishment erected and so far from seeing any
difficulty in obtaining permission, I had no doubt you would give it
all the encouragement in your power, and obtain for him an encreas'd
*location_mentioned*grant */location_mentioned*of land proportionate to the magnitude of the enterprise say
5. 6 or more leagues, perhaps as far as 11 He then said if you would
do so he would send in immediately a thousand spindles with the
force and capital necessary for the operation, and a sufficient 
number of young *person_mentioned*negroes */person_mentioned*under indentures to secure the permanent 
running of the mill, and give you such a share of the net profits as you
should judge reasonable for obtaining an encreas'd quantity of land
(over one league) say one eighth or one tenth. He would prefer
erecting the *location_mentioned*mill on a water course*/location_mentioned* to use water power if it could
be done in a secure and healthy position without going too far from
the *location_mentioned*coast */location_mentioned*otherwise would use steam. I think it would be desirable
to have it near *location_mentioned*S. Filippe*/location_mentioned* if practicable to encourage the growth of
cotton in that *location_mentioned*quarter */location_mentioned*and help build up the *location_mentioned*town */location_mentioned*on the subject oflocation you can give him the best advice. He appears to be a sound
man and has a large capital laying idle*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Mr William Taylor */person_mentioned*our late *person_mentioned*Consul at *location_mentioned*Vera Cruz*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* is now here *person_mentioned*Mr
Ware*/person_mentioned* was introduced to me by him. *person_mentioned*Mr Taylor*/person_mentioned* has retired from
*location_mentioned*Mexican */location_mentioned*business with forty or fifty thousand dollars and appears
to be at loss how to invest his money. *person_mentioned*Mr Ware*/person_mentioned* proposed to him
to join in his *location_mentioned*Texas manufacturing project*/location_mentioned*, which he immediately
assented to, and desired me to request of you to address a copy<barker_pb n="606"/>
of your letter to *person_mentioned*Mr Ware*/person_mentioned*, to him.*person_mentioned* Mr Ware*/person_mentioned* will leave this for
*location_mentioned*Philada */location_mentioned*in four or five weeks and as it is uncertain how long I shall
remain here, as I only wait advices from you to determine my future
course; I have told him I would request you to write directly to
him on the subject and at foot I give you his address also that of
*person_mentioned*Mr Taylor*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*This is not a new project of *person_mentioned*Mr Ware*/person_mentioned*s, he has given his attention
to the subject for some time and has better information respecting
the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*than any man I have ever met with.*/p*

*p*On my own subject, I shall get to the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*in some mode if
my solicitation be granted and shall not engage in anything until
I know the fate of it. My wish would then be to go to *location_mentioned*England */location_mentioned*if
I could raise capital enough, to make arrangements for a direct
trade,—to procure my equipment and goods at the first *location_mentioned*European
cost*/location_mentioned*, with *person_mentioned*english artizans*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*laborers */person_mentioned*to erect my *location_mentioned*buildings */location_mentioned*etc
at a cheap rate—and at the same time see what could be done with
live oak timber, *location_mentioned*rail road*/location_mentioned* etc. If a contract could be made for 
supplying live oak for *location_mentioned**person_mentioned*His Majesty*/person_mentioned*s Dockyard*/location_mentioned* it would throw great
wealth into the *location_mentioned*Colony*/location_mentioned*. There is a *location_mentioned*rail road building*/location_mentioned* here, such
an one might be built in the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*at an expense of 3,000$ pr
mile, 3/4 of which expense would be in the Iron ways, which might
be dispensed with; a *location_mentioned*railroad */location_mentioned*of live oak would not cost over 1,000$
per mile. I wish you would advise me of your intentions respecting
the *location_mentioned*Hawkins lands*/location_mentioned*, it occurs to me that if you were to set off the
*location_mentioned*lands on the east side of the river*/location_mentioned* it might interfere materially with
any arrangement for live oak—besides circumstances might render
it advisable to purchase their right or the lands when set off Who
is their *person_mentioned*agent */person_mentioned*here ?*/p*

*p**location_mentioned*Europe */location_mentioned*is in a very disturbed state and in all probability we shall
soon have a general war there, revolution in *location_mentioned*Spain */location_mentioned*and very possibly
in *location_mentioned*Ireland */location_mentioned*if not in *location_mentioned*England*/location_mentioned*, These circumstances will drive a
large amount of *person_mentioned*European */person_mentioned*capital and labor to *location_mentioned*this side of the
ocean */location_mentioned*if matters can be managed in the *location_mentioned*colony */location_mentioned*to preserve
tranquillity and security and the policy of the Govt continues to be
liberal *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*will spring into importance with astonishing rapidity.*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Henry Austin*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I give you the address of *person_mentioned*Mr. W */person_mentioned*on the envelope*/p*
