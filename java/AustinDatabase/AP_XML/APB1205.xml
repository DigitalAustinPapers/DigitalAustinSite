*p*Dear Sir*/p*

*p*I have just learnt (Indirectly) that you have *person_mentioned*old Roe*/person_mentioned* in custody
and that you inte[n]ded keeping him so until you should hear my
opinion as to what tribe of *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*committed the hostilities on the
*location_mentioned*Guadaloupe */location_mentioned*etc.*/p*

*p*I have to presume that you ear this have been satisfactorily 
informed by *person_mentioned*Mr. Wightman*/person_mentioned* on the subject—I however will state that
there is not a doubt of its haveing been the *person_mentioned*Wakows */person_mentioned*that attacked my
*location_mentioned*house */location_mentioned*and killd *person_mentioned*Whightman*/person_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*There is some doubt as to the *person_mentioned*tribe */person_mentioned*that that *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*belonged to that 
attacked *person_mentioned*Dirben*/person_mentioned*, in as much as they had been encamped several Days
*location_mentioned*near the place where they shot at *person_mentioned*Derbin*/person_mentioned**/location_mentioned* and tho. they were not
trailed from the place, after that they had taken the Horses—yet<barker_pb n="1378"/>
there was on the next morning a trail discovered by *person_mentioned*Mr. phillips*/person_mentioned* in
*location_mentioned*the road west of my house and leading to a crossing of the river*/location_mentioned*-
He followed it, and discovered that 4 horse and one mule had made
said trail and that he believed the mule track to be mine as there
was a Gap in one of hir fore feet—*person_mentioned*Colo. Matson*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*E. Smith*/person_mentioned* crossed
the *location_mentioned*river */location_mentioned*some days after and followed said trail to where it took a
Direct course for *location_mentioned*Laberdee*/location_mentioned*—*person_mentioned*Mr. Smith*/person_mentioned*'s statement as to the number
of horses and the mule coresponded with what *person_mentioned*phillips */person_mentioned*had stated.*/p*

*p*I did on the first view of the premisis suspect that *person_mentioned*the party */person_mentioned*that
fired on *person_mentioned*Derbin */person_mentioned*had been of the main body that killd *person_mentioned*mr. Wightman*/person_mentioned*;
but I am of a Different opinion now, and admit a faint probibelity
that it was the *person_mentioned*Tankawas */person_mentioned*that attacked *person_mentioned*Derbin*/person_mentioned*. I admit this because
they must have been a *person_mentioned*foot party*/person_mentioned*; the horses and mule crossing the
trail of the other *person_mentioned*party */person_mentioned*and that too on a direction to the crossing well
known to the *person_mentioned*tankawas */person_mentioned*and near to my house; and the trail being
made while the due was on, a Monday mor[n]ing.*/p*

*p*I am unable to give an Idea relative to *person_mentioned*Roe*/person_mentioned*. Admit however that
his intentions were bad, he has not been with the *person_mentioned*tankawas */person_mentioned*since he
made threats that I know of; tho I conceive him ameanable to the
Laws for those threats in point of "Malice aforethought."*/p*

*p*It is as yet uncertain what day I shall see you, but I presume not
many—*person_mentioned*Derbin */person_mentioned*is on the men[d] ; the other man *person_mentioned*Mr. Shields*/person_mentioned* I have
rather Dispaired of—*/p*

*p*Note.    Excuse haste.*/p*
