<p>"This is to certify that <person_mentioned>Mr. Martin Allen</person_mentioned> told me that he was
with the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>who made the late attack upon the<person_mentioned> Tonkua 
Indians</person_mentioned>; and that he was very much opposed to shooting, he also
stated, that when he came <location_mentioned>near the camps</location_mentioned> he saw the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>in
great confusion; one standing up talking Spanish, and shewing
every appearance of friendship; frequently heard him say amigo—
<person_mentioned>Mr. Allen</person_mentioned> also stated that he ran forward and halloed don't shoot,
dont shoot, and did every thing in his power to prevent shooting;
but that it had no effect untill part of the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>had fired.

<p>In consequence of reports which have been put in circulation by
<person_mentioned>Mr. Martin Allen</person_mentioned>, calculated to prejudice the <person_mentioned>public </person_mentioned>against the
late encounter with the <person_mentioned>Tonkua Indians</person_mentioned>, we do hereby certify that
the conduct of <person_mentioned>Mr. Allen</person_mentioned> on that occasion was altogether contrary to
what he has since stated it to hare been—We believe, according to
the conduct of<person_mentioned> Mr. Allen</person_mentioned> at the <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned>, and his subsequent declaration,
that he did his utmost to kill an <person_mentioned>Indian</person_mentioned>, and that he lost his hat in
endeavoring to get a Shot—We believe that the conduct of the 
<person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>was such as to induce a reasonable expectation that they
would not submit to lighter punishment than that of killing-—They
shewed no disposition either by words or signs, to give the <person_mentioned>company</person_mentioned>
a friendly reception.—Nor did they cry out Amigo as has been
stated by <person_mentioned>Mr. Allen</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Mr. Allen</person_mentioned>'s alleged mediation in favor of them
is without foundation It has been stated that the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>entered
the <location_mentioned>Indian camps</location_mentioned> with their guns cocked and presented; this we
consider as a malicious and unfounded falsehood

days before the late attack was made upon them, and encamped
 <location_mentioned>within half a mile or three quarters of myhouse</location_mentioned>;—They remain at
that camp about two days; on the second day six of my hogs were
missing; I supposed they had been killed by the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, because
they slept at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>every night, and none of them had been killed
by vermin for a considerable time before, and I believe nothing else
could have killed so many in one day—One of the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>I knew
to be of the <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>that broke open my <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>upwards of <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1825">twelve

<p>" I do hereby certify that a party of <person_mentioned>Tonkuas </person_mentioned>came to my <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>a
few days before the late attack was made upon them; my <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>being
alone, and not knowing what <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>they were, was very much
alarmed at the sight of them,—She immediately left the <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>
and endeavored to get to the <location_mentioned>field </location_mentioned>where I was at work; on her way
to the field she saw two or three <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>coming towards her, she
then started to run, one of them ran after her with a large butcher
knife in his hand, caught her by the hand and endeavored to make
her return to the <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>, but finding she was determined not to com-<barker_pb n="1321"/>
ply, he took her shoes off her feet; She then began to halloo for me,
upon which he let her go and said amigo; not understanding him
she kept on to the field; I immediately went to the <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>but the
<person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>were gone and had left her shoes in the yard

<p>" We certify that a few days previous to the late affair with the
<person_mentioned>Tonkuas</person_mentioned>, a <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>of them came to our <location_mentioned>camp </location_mentioned>and stole upwards
of five bushels of corn which lay at a short distance from the <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned>;
they also took a few pounds of meat, cut up too gunrods and two
strait edges that were used in hewing, and carried off a whet stone;
the meat might possibly have been destroyed by vermin but the
other things could have been taken by nothing but the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned></p>
