*p*Dr Sir*/p*

*p*I arrived here *date_mentioned n="08-08-1834">yesterday morning*/date_mentioned* and expect to leave, on 
*date_mentioned n="08-11-1834">Monday*/date_mentioned*—-accompanying *person_mentioned*Col Almonte*/person_mentioned* We are informed on good 
authority, that the cholera is in *location_mentioned*San Antonio-*/location_mentioned*—deaths 6 or 7 a day,—
it commenced about the *date_mentioned n="07-27-1834">27th last month*/date_mentioned*—We are in hopes it will
have abated by the time we get on—*/p*

*p**person_mentioned*Johnson */person_mentioned*writes from there, that he will be able to procure a 
favorable address from the *person_mentioned*Ayuntamiento*/person_mentioned*.-—*/p*

*p*I have seen the one from *location_mentioned*Matagorda*/location_mentioned*, which is a considerable
improvement on the first, but not so full as I could have wished—
The Liberty Memorial is well written and is <hi rend="italic">perhaps </hi>very good as
to the substance tho' there is a little of it I do not like altogether.*/p*

*p*The one from the *location_mentioned*Colorado*/location_mentioned*, *person_mentioned*Johnson */person_mentioned*has with him We shall get
it from him at *location_mentioned*San Antonio*/location_mentioned* where it appears lie will remain-*/p*

*p*But my main dependence is on *person_mentioned*Almonte*/person_mentioned*-—There is no very 
important, additional information as to the progress of the 
Revolution.—4000 *person_mentioned*Sta Anna*/person_mentioned* men, have marched against *location_mentioned*San Louis Potosi*/location_mentioned*— *location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned*is measurably quiet. We have heard, (to heighten our 
distresses) that there is even a State Revolution—*location_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Saltillo </hi>*/location_mentioned*against 
<hi rend="italic">Monclova</hi>. It seems that the *person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*of the former place have set up a
*person_mentioned*governor */person_mentioned*of their own, in opposition to the one at *location_mentioned*Monclova */location_mentioned*and
threaten to storm the place, if the Official papers of all kind, are not
given up to them—all is no doubt the work of a *person_mentioned*licentious mob*/person_mentioned*—-
What is to come of it I know not of course—as I suppose no one
else does—*/p*

*p*I will write you from *location_mentioned*San Antonio*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*I have had some talk with the *person_mentioned*Colo */person_mentioned*on the subject of this State
disorder—He laments it but thinks he <hi rend="italic">understands </hi>the cause and
that all will be well soon—Time will tell best.*/p*
