*p**location_mentioned*Mexico */location_mentioned**date_mentioned n="09-11-1833">Sept. 11 1833*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p*Dr *person_mentioned*Brother*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I have nothing particular to say, more than what I informed you
of by last mail. The cholera has abated, but there is not yet a 
*person_mentioned*majority of members*/person_mentioned* in this *location_mentioned*city */location_mentioned*so that there will be no meeting of
*person_mentioned*Congress */person_mentioned*for a week or ten days yet.*/p*

*p*I think I shall succeed in getting the 11 article of*date_mentioned n="04-06-1830"> 6 april*/date_mentioned* law 
repealed—the establishment of weekly mails from *location_mentioned*Monclova */location_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Sabine*/location_mentioned*,
from *location_mentioned*Matamoras */location_mentioned*to *location_mentioned*Goliad */location_mentioned*and from *location_mentioned*San Felipe*/location_mentioned* to *location_mentioned*Brazoria */location_mentioned*and
*location_mentioned*Liberty*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*The duties on Importations will be reduced and probably 
suspended, for a time in to to, tho the latter is not yet certain.*/p*

*p*The State question must take its course as prescribed in the 
constitution and be sent to the *location_mentioned*other States*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*The revolution is not over and God knows when it will be. I
have great confidence in the *person_mentioned*vice president Gomez Farias*/person_mentioned*, If the
*person_mentioned*heroes */person_mentioned*of the + [cross] get the upper hand it is difficult to say what
they will do as to *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*matters and it is very probable there will<barker_pb n="1006"/>
be a breaking up of the *person_mentioned*Govt*/person_mentioned*.   But there is no prospect that they
will succeed at present.*/p*

*p*In *date_mentioned n="10-xx-1833">October */date_mentioned*the time expires for locating *location_mentioned*grants*/location_mentioned*. See that *person_mentioned*Williams*/person_mentioned*
attends to all that business and also to *person_mentioned*Padilla*/person_mentioned*s—dont neglect this.
Also try and collect something on the notes due me. I shall spend
about 2000 Dollars or probably 2,500 on this trip and as I am 
laboring for the common good no honest man will refuse to pay what he
justly owes me.*/p*

*p*Were it not for you and *person_mentioned*Emily */person_mentioned*and the *person_mentioned*<hi rend="italic">Old Settlers</hi>*/person_mentioned* I doubt
whether I Should not remain here for a year or two—that is unless
the revolution continues, for then no one will be safe here.*/p*

*p*I have recd, <hi rend="italic">one </hi>letter from *location_mentioned*Texas */location_mentioned*since I left there, from
*person_mentioned*John */person_mentioned*dated in *date_mentioned n="06-xx-1833">June*/date_mentioned*—I have written every mail since I arrived
here, I hope the *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*are all well at *location_mentioned*Chocolate Bayou*/location_mentioned*. I have
more confidence of health there than at *location_mentioned*peach point*/location_mentioned* I do not know
whether *person_mentioned*Williams */person_mentioned*has returned—or not—he was to have left *location_mentioned*Mobile*/location_mentioned*
about the middle of *date_mentioned n="07-15-1833">July */date_mentioned*as he wrote me from there. Tell *person_mentioned*John*/person_mentioned*
to keep clear of *person_mentioned*land speculators*/person_mentioned*. I had rather herd with devils than
with that class of mankind.*/p*

*p*I am unhappy that I do not hear from you—how are the *person_mentioned*children*/person_mentioned*—
what kind of a crop—how is *person_mentioned*Stephen (my brothers boy)*/person_mentioned* and your
*person_mentioned*neighbors */person_mentioned*and a thousand things,*/p*

*p*My health is good at this time*/p*

*p*farewell                             *person_mentioned* S. F. A*/person_mentioned*—*/p*

*p*There were *person_mentioned*43000 sick*/person_mentioned* here at one time The deaths I believe have
been about 18000. I have never witnessed such a horrible scene of
distress and death. The *person_mentioned*common people*/person_mentioned* in a part of the state of
*location_mentioned*Puebla */location_mentioned*got an idea that the water was poisoned by the *person_mentioned*foreigners*/person_mentioned*
and they massacred seven *person_mentioned*frenchmen */person_mentioned*in one *location_mentioned*village*/location_mentioned*—all the 
*person_mentioned*foreigners */person_mentioned*in that place. Remember me to *person_mentioned*H Austin*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Phillips */person_mentioned*and his
*person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*and to your *person_mentioned*neighbors*/person_mentioned*—tell *person_mentioned*Henry */person_mentioned*that he must not neglect to
locate his *location_mentioned*other League of land*/location_mentioned* before the time expires.*/p*

*p*I cannot tell when I shall get home I intend to persevere to the
end and effect what I came for if I can regardless of time or expense.*/p*
