*p**date_mentioned n="01-03-1828">3rd Jany. 1828*/date_mentioned**/p*
*p**person_mentioned*D. Colo*/person_mentioned**/p*

*p*I beg leave to introduce to your aquantence and notice *person_mentioned*Mr Silus,
Ephram*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Benjmn Fuqua*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Mr Job Ingram*/person_mentioned* and *person_mentioned*Kye Ingram*/person_mentioned*,
these *person_mentioned*Gentlemen */person_mentioned*have emigrated to your *location_mentioned*Coloney */location_mentioned*to become 
permanent *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*—The *person_mentioned*Mr Fuquas*/person_mentioned* are *person_mentioned*Mechanics*/person_mentioned*, two of them of the
best kind; they are honest and respectable *person_mentioned*men */person_mentioned*and are determined
to suport the Government to which they go, I have had much
conversation with *person_mentioned*Mr Silus Fuqua*/person_mentioned*, on the present and future 
prospects of your *location_mentioned*coloney*/location_mentioned*; and tho he has never seen it, he has a most
corect idea of its great advantages, you will find him an inteligent
man and I have no doubt will be an acquisition to your *location_mentioned*Setlement*/location_mentioned*, I
have known these *person_mentioned*gentlemen */person_mentioned*twelve years, the *person_mentioned*Mr Ingrains*/person_mentioned* I have
not known personaly but from their universal good character and
the *person_mentioned*Gentlemen */person_mentioned*they go with, I feel no hesitation to recomend them
to your attention;*/p*

*p*On my arival in the*location_mentioned* U. S.*/location_mentioned* I found Agriculture fast declining in
all the *location_mentioned*Middle and Southern region of our country,*/location_mentioned* oppressed with
heavey duties on imports from a broad and taxes at *location_mentioned*home*/location_mentioned*, and the
*person_mentioned*people */person_mentioned*burthened with debts, many of which were no doubt 
contracted in more <hi rend="italic">prosperous times</hi> that I could not help runing a
parallel in my mind between the happy condition of the *person_mentioned*adopted
citizens */person_mentioned*of your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and the people of this; indeed frankness
and candure impels me not to withold from you the expressions of
the opinions and thoughts that have so repetedly obtruded 
themselves on my mind; (that is) that every *person_mentioned*family */person_mentioned*ought to bless his<barker_pb n="3"/>
happy star that conduced them to a *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*blessed with the finest
soil in *location_mentioned*North Amarica*/location_mentioned*, with plenty, health, peace and happiness—
and if they act wisely (as I hope and trust they will) they will
foster and cherish the Government they live in, which will be the
certain means of preserving their estamible rights unimpaired; and
a sure protection of their property—while on the contrary in this
*location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*there are hundreds and thousands of *person_mentioned*familes */person_mentioned*who do not
own a foot of land nor have they any hope of ever doing so (I mean
of any <hi rend="italic">real value</hi>) who are barely able to sustain themselves with
the most common coarse food and raiment—In the short time since
my arival at home I have assertained beyond question that 40 or 50
*person_mentioned*families */person_mentioned*would emigrate with me *date_mentioned n="Fall - 1829">next fall*/date_mentioned* to your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*if they
could introduce their *person_mentioned*slaves*/person_mentioned*, many of them are *person_mentioned*large holders*/person_mentioned* of that
description of *person_mentioned*property*/person_mentioned*; and I consider it a duty I owe myself as
well as you, to assure you that I shall moove to your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*next
*date_mentioned n="Fall- 1829">fall */date_mentioned*if I can with safety bring mine; for I find I have not one *person_mentioned*slave*/person_mentioned* that is willing to be sold from me*/p*;

*p*I feel a deep interest in the prosperity of your *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*and hope
you will do me the favour (for I shall prise it highly) to write to me
by the *person_mentioned*first safe hand*/person_mentioned* after the receipt of this letter; let me know if
we will be alowed to bring in *person_mentioned*Slaves */person_mentioned*under any circumstances, if not
what are the future prospects—what has been done with my 
petition, can I locate the *location_mentioned*Heseandar */location_mentioned*[hacienda] *location_mentioned*on the west bank of the
colorado River*/location_mentioned**/p*

*p*If I can bring in fifty *person_mentioned*families*/person_mentioned*, I believe I can get $50. a *location_mentioned*League*/location_mentioned*
from them, and I should give you one half if you will reserve good
land for them as I have always thought that compensation not
enough for the *person_mentioned*founder of a colony*/person_mentioned* in adition to his *location_mentioned*premium lands*/location_mentioned*—
but this will depend on the <hi rend="italic">*person_mentioned*Slave */person_mentioned*Question</hi> can *location_mentioned*fifty good Leagues
be got between the colorado and auroyo lavaca—*/location_mentioned*that is now vacant—
I know when you reach home how much you will be provoked and
how much you will (on <hi rend="italic">many acounts</hi>) regret the deception and
fraud played off on me and many respectable *person_mentioned*citizens */person_mentioned*of your *location_mentioned*colony*/location_mentioned*
by *person_mentioned*William Pettus*/person_mentioned*—for he even sold my *person_mentioned*boddy servant*/person_mentioned* and did not
take (perhaps) a dollar with him to the *location_mentioned*Rio Grande*/location_mentioned* to purchase
Mules for me, for his *person_mentioned*wife */person_mentioned*said in my presens she allways blamed
him for not carring the money with him; nor have I received one
cent for the fine mar I caried to that *location_mentioned*country */location_mentioned*for all he paid me
dos not even pay the interest upon the debt—I paid for him as an
inocent security Such an abuse of confidence, and once I admit
friendship; proves beyond the most remote possibility of a doubt, a
dereliction of all honourable principal and a depravity of <hi rend="italic">hart </hi>that
can never be reclaimed nor reformed, I believe I might use the same
language to you *person_mentioned*Sir John Falstaff*/person_mentioned* did to *person_mentioned*prince Henry*/person_mentioned* (of *location_mentioned*Poins*/location_mentioned*)<barker_pb n="4"/>
"he is the most omnipotent *person_mentioned*villain */person_mentioned*that ever cried stand to a true
man's what he has done with all the property, goods and money,
he had*/p*
