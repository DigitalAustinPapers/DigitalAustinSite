*p*I arrived *date_mentioned n="09-22-1826">last evening */date_mentioned*after a fatigueing journey—I proceeded to
visit the *person_mentioned*Baron */person_mentioned*immediately he is in good health—to day I have not
been able to collect much interesting News for you—the mail starts
this *date_mentioned n="09-23-1826">evening */date_mentioned*and it is now so late I shall not be able to write any
thing satisfactorily until next post—The *person_mentioned*Slave */person_mentioned*question is undecided
as yet. The *person_mentioned*Baron */person_mentioned*has done his best—but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> opposed <hi rend="italic">to </hi>so large a

*p*He will lay before the *person_mentioned*house */person_mentioned*a bill, in a day or two for the benefit
of the *person_mentioned*300 families */person_mentioned*and thinks there is no doubt but the *person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*
introduced by them will be held—he also states that he will never sign
the Constitution if they persist in so <hi rend="italic">unjust </hi>an imposition on the
rights of the *person_mentioned*settlers*/person_mentioned*—it is the opinion of the *person_mentioned*Baron */person_mentioned*that a further
introduction of *person_mentioned*slaves */person_mentioned*is out of the question—in another Legislature,
a favourable *person_mentioned*Slave */person_mentioned*law might be procured, but the present one is<barker_pb n="1462"/>
composed of *person_mentioned*members */person_mentioned*so inimical to the interests of *location_mentioned*Texas*/location_mentioned*, that the

<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>—and in a short time the winter will <hi rend="italic">set in</hi>; and his age and
infirmaties will not permit him to travel—It is all important that the

greatest importance the *location_mentioned*Baron */location_mentioned*should return to conclude the business
of the *location_mentioned*Colony */location_mentioned*but is impossible for him to do so until *date_mentioned n="03-xx-1827">March */date_mentioned*or
*date_mentioned n="04-xx-1827">April*/date_mentioned*—I presume you heard of the confusion that has existed in the
Legislature and which has caused more <hi rend="italic">delay </hi>in the progress of the
discussions of that body than any thing else—the substance of the
whole is—the *person_mentioned*People */person_mentioned*had become disgusted with the proceedings—
and demanded a new Election or the Constitution—Every thing is
quiet at present—and the *person_mentioned*Legislature */person_mentioned*will probabl use more
