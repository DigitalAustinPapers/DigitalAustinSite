<p>[From  Bexar Archives]</p>

<p>I have Just received information by two <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>immediately from
<location_mentioned>Bejar</location_mentioned>; that a large <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, supposed to be 100, all mounted
have crossed <location>mentionedthe road leading from this place to Bejar</location_mentioned>,<location_mentioned> at the 52
mile tree</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>about 24 miles from here</location_mentioned>—-and have bent their course for
<location_mentioned>la Bahia</location_mentioned>— My number here is too weak to follow them, as it is
beleaved that there is also another <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>in the direction of the
<location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>—and I am only able to keep out <person_mentioned>spies </person_mentioned>and to watch them,
least they should make an attack on this <location_mentioned>place</location_mentioned>—. I have ordered an
<person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>this morning to<location_mentioned> La Bahia</location_mentioned>, and hope he will be there in time
to alarm the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>that they may have the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>on the alert;
and that they may therefore defeat them in their designs, which I
have reason to beleave is to both kill and rob, this I send you, for
your information: God and Liberty</p>
