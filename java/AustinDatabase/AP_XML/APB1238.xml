*div1 type="body"*

*p*I inclose to your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*the original and translation of an 
application of *person_mentioned*Burrel J. Thompson*/person_mentioned* of the *location_mentioned*District of Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*, for
authority to raise a *person_mentioned*company of mounted volunteers */person_mentioned*to assist in 
defending this *location_mentioned*frontier*/location_mentioned*, and two other papers on the same subject, which
he sent to me to be translated. These *person_mentioned*volunteers */person_mentioned*have offered me their
services, through *person_mentioned*Thompson*/person_mentioned*, to fight our *person_mentioned*Indian enemies*/person_mentioned*. I have 
informed them that I was not authorized to accept their offer, unless it
is made through the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*of their *location_mentioned*District*/location_mentioned*, or with your *person_mentioned*Lordship's*/person_mentioned*
previous sanction.*/p*<barker_pb n="1404"/>

*p*I am fully aware that there are many cavilling *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, disposed to
complain of the *person_mentioned*authorities */person_mentioned*without cause, and, even, to interfere with
them. As I am not acquainted with all the reasons that induced the
*person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*to prohibit the organization of that *person_mentioned*company*/person_mentioned*, I cannot give
a decisive opinion on the subject; but from what I could learn of the
character and intentions of these *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*, I see no impropriety in 
allowing them to form a *person_mentioned*company*/person_mentioned*, and I have no doubt that it would be
advisable to accept their services to fill the place of the sixty *person_mentioned*men*/person_mentioned*
whom the *person_mentioned*Alcalde */person_mentioned*has [been] ordered to furnish me with in an 
emergency. But your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*will be better able to judge. I have 
submitted this subject to your *person_mentioned*Lordship */person_mentioned*at the request of the *person_mentioned*parties*/person_mentioned*
interested, on account of their ignorance of the Spanish language,
and not with an intention to interfere with the business of the 
*location_mentioned*District of Nacogdoches*/location_mentioned*.*/p*

*p*I have also received from the *person_mentioned*people of the *location_mentioned*Trinity*/location_mentioned**/person_mentioned* a verbal tender
of their services against the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*should they be required; I 
answered them that I had no authority to accept them without your
*person_mentioned*Lordship*/person_mentioned*'s consent.*/p*

*p*There is no doubt when the cold season sets in that the *person_mentioned*Indians */person_mentioned*will
attack us, and I consider it important to be ready for them in time.*/p*

*p*God and Liberty*/p*.
